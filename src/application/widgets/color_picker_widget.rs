//! JSON-backed spec for the color picker widget.

//! Loaded once via `include_str!` + `OnceLock` — so the JSON ships
//! inside the binary (works on native AND WASM — `fs::read` is not
//! an option in a browser) and parsing amortizes across every
//! picker-open after the first.
//!
//! The Rust side exposes getters that return `&'static [...]` slices
//! so every call-site in the renderer / app / tests can read glyphs
//! and geometry without knowing a JSON even exists. That separation
//! keeps the hot render path free of serde.
