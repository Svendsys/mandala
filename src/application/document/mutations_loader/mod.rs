//! Four-source mutation loader: application bundle, user file, map,
//! inline-on-node — in ascending precedence.
//!
//! **Source-of-truth note:** the precedence order (App < User < Map
//! < Inline) is documented in `format/mutations.md` under "Where
//! mutations come from." Code mirrors the doc — the [`MutationSource`]
//! enum variant order and
//! [`crate::application::document::MindMapDocument::build_mutation_registry_with_app_and_user`]
//! encode the same ordering. Changes to the set or order update all
//! three sites in the same commit.
//!
//! This module owns the outer loader (app + user slices produced in
//! `load_app_and_user`), the app-bundle parser ([`builtin`]), and the
//! platform-split user-file readers (`platform_desktop` /
//! `platform_web`). The two readers are cfg-gated to their target
//! and cargo doc would warn under "unresolved link" for the inactive
//! one if they were intra-doc links.
//!
//! Resilience posture (§7): every layer is best-effort. Failures log
//! `warn!` and fall through to the next source; the app never crashes
//! on a bad user file. The application bundle, by contrast, is a
//! build-time invariant and is parsed with `expect()` — a malformed
//! bundle is a startup-time bug, not a user input error.
