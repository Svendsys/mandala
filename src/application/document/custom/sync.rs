/// `apply_custom_mutation` gates the undo-stack push and the
/// `dirty` flag on it (P0-02, #2: "No undo entries for no-op
/// applies"). That gate is only worth anything if the verdict is
/// *tight*: a sync against a tree the model just produced, with no
/// mutation in between, must report `false` for every node.
///
/// Any selective-gate comparison that reads a lossy forward
/// conversion backwards breaks the property silently — the model
/// stays byte-identical, but the verdict says "changed" and a dead
/// undo entry lands on the stack, eating the user's next Ctrl-Z.
