//! Triple-state edit primitive (`Keep` / `Clear` / `Set`) and the
//! field-level fold helpers that consume it. These are the
//! building blocks every node-style setter routes its
//! per-field "leave alone vs clear vs write" decision through —
//! the shared shape is what lets a single console verb stage a
//! mix of `font=off` / `padding=4` / (untouched preset) edits and
//! hand the bundle to one atomic setter.

/// Triple-state edit on an `Option<T>` field. The three variants
/// distinguish "leave alone" from "explicitly clear an existing
/// override" from "set to a concrete value". Used by the
/// `BorderConfigEdits` bundle (every per-field slot is one of these)
/// and by the zoom-visibility setters (where a console line like
/// `zoom min=1.5 max=unset` translates each kv into an
/// `OptionEdit<f32>` so a single setter call handles both sides
/// atomically). The shared shape is what makes the console verbs'
/// `palette=off` / `font=off` / `min=unset` syntax possible —
/// without `Clear`, callers couldn't distinguish "the user didn't
/// mention this field" from "the user wants this field cleared".
///
/// `Keep` is the default so [`BorderConfigEdits`]'s
/// `#[derive(Default)]` builds the no-op edit set, and the console
/// verb only fills in the keys the user actually typed.
