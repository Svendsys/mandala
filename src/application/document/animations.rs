    // Animations are an *envelope* on `apply_custom_mutation` — when
    // a `CustomMutation` carries `timing: Some(AnimationTiming { ... })`
    // with a non-zero `duration_ms`, the dispatcher routes it through
    // `start_animation` instead of applying instantly. Each tick
    // computes a blended `MindNode` snapshot and writes it back into
    // `mindmap.nodes` so the existing `rebuild_all` path sees the
    // in-progress state and repaints. The tree never sees the from
    // state mid-flight; the render pipeline reads model → builds tree
    // → walks → shapes, so the model write is the single source of
    // truth for the animated frame.
    //
    // The architecture mirrors the dragging / editing invariant: the
    // *tree* (or in this case, the model — drag and edit work
    // tree-only because they're transient previews) carries the
    // in-progress state, the model is the boundary commit. For
    // animations we write to the model directly because the
    // animation IS the commit — `apply_custom_mutation` would have
    // produced the same final state anyway, just in one step
    // instead of many. The undo entry is pushed once at completion.
    //
    // Interpolation scope: position / size / color are the candidate
    // fields; structural changes (text replacement, region count
    // shifts) snap at the boundary. Currently only `position` is
    // interpolated — the other fields need per-mutation snapshot
    // logic that's deferred until a concrete consumer arrives.

    /// Start an animation for `cm` targeting `target_id`. Snapshots
    /// the current node state, applies the mutation to a scratch
