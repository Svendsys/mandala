//! Magical glyph-wheel color picker — a custom modal overlay for choosing
//! colors that fits Mandala's "everything is a positioned glyph" aesthetic.
//!
//! Layout: a 24-glyph hue ring forming a mandala, a crosshair sat/value
//! selector formed by two perpendicular glyph bars meeting at the wheel
//! center, a central preview glyph showing the currently-previewed color,
//! and a row of theme-variable quick-pick chips below. Mouse hover updates
//! the preview live; click commits, click outside cancels. Keyboard
//! fallback: h/H nudges hue, s/S sat, v/V value, Tab cycles chips, Enter
//! commits, Esc cancels.
//!
//! The picker wires to `MindEdge.color` (via `set_edge_color`) and the
//! three node colour axes. Portal-mode edges flow through the same
//! `set_edge_color` sink as line-mode edges — portals are a render mode
//! on the same entity, so there's no separate portal setter. Node
//! colors and theme-variable editing become a follow-up session.
//!
//! Live preview uses direct in-place model mutation during hover —
//! mirroring `apply_edge_handle_drag` in `app.rs`. The pre-picker
//! snapshot is captured at open time, so cancel restores it without
//! touching the undo stack and commit pushes a single `EditEdge` entry.
//!
//! Pure-function layout (`compute_color_picker_layout`) and hit-testing
//! (`hit_test_picker`) are extracted so unit tests don't need a GPU.
