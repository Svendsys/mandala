//! Glyph-wheel color picker overlay: tree / mutator / area builders
//! for the picker the user opens from an edge or portal context menu
//! (modal) or via the `color picker` console command (standalone
//! palette).
//!
//! Public surface is two functions and a [`ColorPickerOverlayBuild`]
//! result: [`build`] produces a fresh `(tree, backdrop)` from a
//! geometry + layout, [`build_mutator`] produces an in-place
//! `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>` that updates the same tree's channels
//! without rebuilding the arena. Layout is computed once at the
//! dispatch site (app.rs `compute_picker_geometry`) and threaded
//! through to every builder so the per-frame hot path doesn't
//! recompute font-size derivation, cell anchor math, or backdrop
//! geometry. Picker spec and the `(GlyphArea, GlyphModel)` pair shape
//! stay internal to the module.
