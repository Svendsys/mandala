//! Differential oracle over the whole console grammar.
//!
//! Three views of every verb — what it accepts, what it rejects and
//! with which exact words, and what its completion popup offers —
//! recorded as data so a refactor of the machinery underneath is
//! answerable in one place. The corpus lives in
//! [`super::oracle_corpus`]; the pinned answers in
//! [`super::oracle_expected`]; the comparison is the three tests at
//! the bottom of this file.
//!
//! This exists because the console's grammar was hand-written two
//! to four times per verb (parse, complete, usage, hints) and the
//! copies drifted. The oracle is what makes "the framework changed
//! nothing a user can see" a checkable claim rather than a hope.
//!
//! # What the oracle does not see
//!
//! [`exec_signature`] renders the [`ExecResult`] and nothing else.
//! It drops the [`ConsoleEffects`] the verb filled in — the side
//! effect, the `close_console` flag, the undo entry — and it drops
//! the mutated document, which it then throws away. So a row
//! pinned as `"OK …"` says the verb accepted the line and worded
//! its acknowledgment that way; it does not say a write landed,
//! and the six rows whose verbs answer `ExecResult::ok_empty()`
//! (`color pick|bg|text|border`, `color picker on|off`) pin
//! nothing beyond `"OK "` itself — for those the side effect the
//! signature discards *is* the whole behavior.
//!
//! That is the deliberate scope: accepts / rejects with which
//! words / what the popup offers. It is not a substitute for the
//! per-verb tests that assert against the document, and a green
//! oracle is not evidence that a mutation is correct. Widening the
//! signature to cover effects and document state would make it
//! one, and is the obvious next move on this file.
