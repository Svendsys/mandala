//! `new [path]` — start a fresh, blank mindmap.
//!
//! Like `open`, refuses to discard a dirty document. Without a path
//! the new map is unbound — `save` will require an explicit path
//! before it can write. With a path, the blank map is also written
//! immediately so the binding is real on disk and `Ctrl+S` works
//! from then on.
