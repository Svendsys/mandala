/// whose color matched the pre-edit default (per-run overrides are
/// preserved). For edges this is the label / line color. For
/// portals it is unsupported.

/// Target supports receiving a color from the **standalone color
/// wheel** (the `color picker on` persistent palette). The wheel
/// doesn't pick an axis — it pushes one color at the selection and
/// asks each component type to decide which channel that color
/// belongs on. Nodes take it on `Bg`; edges take it on their single
/// color field (routed through `set_border_color`, which is the same
/// sink as `set_text_color` for edges). Portals haven't been ported
/// to Baumhard yet — they return `NotApplicable` today and will
/// switch to their fill channel once the port lands.
///
/// Separate trait from `HasBgColor` / `HasTextColor` / `HasBorderColor`
/// by design: the `Has*` axis traits answer "can you accept a color
/// on channel X?"; `AcceptsWheelColor` answers the narrower question
/// "if someone hands you one color without specifying a channel,
/// where does it go?". The default-channel choice belongs with the
/// component implementation, not with every caller.

/// `font set <name>` verb pushes one family-name string at the
/// selection and asks each component type to decide which channel
/// the font choice belongs on.
///
/// Per-variant routing (Step 3 of the font plan):
/// - **Node** writes every `TextRun.font` (the node has no
///   per-channel font split today).
/// - **Edge** writes `glyph_connection.font`.
/// - **PortalLabel** routes through the edge's `glyph_connection.font`
///   — the icon shares the edge body's font, same routing
///   `font size=` already uses for portal-icon selections.
/// - **EdgeLabel** and **PortalText** return
///   [`Outcome::NotApplicable`]. Their config structs do not yet
///   carry a `font_family` slot of their own; today they inherit
///   the edge body's font. A future commit can add per-channel
///   slots when the graphical font picker calls for it.
///
/// `family` is the family-name string the data model stores
/// (`TextRun.font` / `GlyphConnectionConfig.font`), as listed by
/// `baumhard::font::fonts::list_loaded_families`. Validation —
/// "is this a loaded font?" — is the caller's job: by the time
/// the trait runs, the value has been picked from the same list.
/// `Outcome::Invalid` is reserved for programmatic callers that
/// bypass validation; the console verb rejects unknown families
/// upstream with a helpful message.

/// paste results the same way it aggregates color or font results.

/// clipboard by the event loop before the trait call. The trait
/// method decides how to integrate it (parse a hex color, set node
/// text, etc.) and reports the result.
