//! The declarative console grammar, and the one engine that reads it.
//!
//! Every console verb used to hand-write the same four things: a
//! subverb match with its unknown-subverb message, a kv loop with
//! unknown-key rejection, a `usage` literal, and a `complete` fn
//! that re-encoded the first two positionally. Four copies of one
//! grammar per verb, twenty verbs, and nothing holding the copies
//! together — which is how `font range=` came to be parseable,
//! named in the verb's own rejection, offered by no popup and
//! absent from `help font`, with the suite green.
//!
//! A [`Grammar`] replaces all four. It is a **level**, not a verb:
//! `border` is one, `border preview` is another, and
//! `canvas section-frame focused` is a third, each joined to its
//! parent by a `&'static` reference through [`Subverb::child`].
//! [`Grammar::subverb_sets`] and [`Grammar::key_sets`] are slices
//! *of slices* so a level composes its neighbors' vocabulary
//! without copying a row — `canvas border` is border's fifteen keys
//! and border's seven per-field subverbs, named rather than
//! transcribed.
//!
//! # What one declaration answers
//!
//! - **Completion**, through [`complete::completions`]: descend the
//!   positional tokens that name subverbs, stop at the first that
//!   does not, then offer this level's subverbs (at the subverb
//!   slot), the slot vocabulary under the cursor, and the kv keys
//!   of the matched form once its *required* slots sit behind the
//!   cursor. That last clause is what keeps `border preset <TAB>` a
//!   preset list while `section resize <TAB>` offers `fill` beside
//!   `w=` / `h=`.
//! - **Usage and tags**, through [`usage`]. `help` prints derived
//!   forms; a key added to a [`Grammar`] is documented by the same
//!   edit that makes it parseable.
//! - **The kv loop**, through [`kvs::read`]: unknown keys rejected
//!   by name, and keys the *shape being typed* does not read
//!   rejected by name too — `border preset heavy color=#fff` used to
//!   stage the preset and drop the color without a word, and
//!   `section resize fill w=99` used to drop the size.
//! - **The hint surface**: one [`Word::hint`] per vocabulary entry
//!   and one [`Key::hint`] per key, read by the popup and by the
//!   `<…>` a usage form prints.
//!
//! # What stays hand-written
//!
//! Value parsing and document mutation. A [`Key`] declares its
//! name, its sentence and its vocabulary; what `padding=8` *means*
//! is the verb's, and stays in the verb. Bespoke semantics —
//! `section move`'s mutually exclusive delta / absolute forms, the
//! `border side` non-custom-preset gate — stay as handwritten
//! handlers *behind* the table rather than as engine concepts.
//!
//! # No verb sees a raw token index
//!
//! The engine hands a verb a [`descent::Descent`], never an index
//! into the token list. Eight completion sites once did their
//! lookahead with `tokens.get(N)` while the arms they fed were
//! keyed on the *positional* index, and the two disagree the moment
//! a kv pair sits earlier on the line. Descent is the only thing
//! here that touches token order.
