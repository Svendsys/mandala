//! Registry-wide invariants over every declared [`Grammar`], and

//!
//! These are the checks that replace the per-verb assertions #128
//! had to write twice and called "a per-verb copy of a check, i.e.
//! more of the same disease". They walk the whole registry, every
//! nesting level, and hold the declaration against itself in both
//! directions — a form naming a key its level does not declare, and
//! a key no form prints. The second is the one that would have
//! caught `font range=`, `color range=` and `color section=` on the
//! day each was written: each was parseable, named in the verb's own
//! rejection, and absent from the list `help` printed.
//!
//! Holding the declaration against itself is not enough on its own,
//! because a verb can decline to ask. `label` printed a
//! hand-written usage literal naming two of the four keys it
//! declares, so its popup, its `help` page and its kv rejection all
//! said four while the verb itself said two — and every invariant
//! here stayed green, because every one of them read the table
//! rather than the verb.
//! [`test_no_console_verb_hand_writes_its_own_usage_line`] is the
//! direction that catches that: it reads the sources under
//! `commands/` instead of the registry.
