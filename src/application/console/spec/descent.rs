//! Grammar descent — the one place in the console that reads token
//! order.
//!
//! A line is walked once: match the positional at this level's
//! subverb slot, step into that subverb's child level if it has
//! one, stop otherwise. The result is a [`Descent`], which names
//! the level reached, the subverb matched there, and the positional
//! slot the subverb sat in — never a raw token index. Everything a
//! verb wants to know about "what came before me" is answered from
//! that, which is what keeps a `Token { index }` arm and its
//! lookahead counting the same slots.
//!
//! The walk also owns the **positional-vs-kv discriminator**, since
//! it is a question about token order and about nothing else.
