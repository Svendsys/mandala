//! CLI-style console for Mandala.
//!
//! Input is tokenized shell-style — whitespace splits, `"quoted
//! strings"` preserve spaces, and `key=value` tokens are first-class.
//! Generic commands (`color` / `font` / `label`) dispatch through
//! the [`traits`] capability traits and fan out over the current
//! selection via [`traits::TargetView`]; component-specific commands
//! (`anchor` / `body` / `cap` / `spacing` / `edge` / `portal`) call
//! their own `MindMapDocument` setters directly.
//!
//! Completion is contextual and prefix-matched. The popup recomputes
//! on every keystroke; `↑`/`↓` move the highlight (falling back to
//! command history when the popup is empty), `Tab` accepts the
//! highlighted row, `Esc` dismisses the popup, then the console.
