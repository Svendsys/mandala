//! CLI-style console for Mandala.
//!
//! Input is tokenized shell-style — whitespace splits, `"quoted
//! strings"` preserve spaces, and `key=value` tokens are first-class.
//! Generic commands (`color` / `font` / `label`) dispatch through
//! the [`traits`] capability traits and fan out over the current
//! selection via [`traits::TargetView`]; component-specific commands
//! (`anchor` / `body` / `cap` / `spacing` / `edge` / `portal`) call
//! their own `MindMapDocument` setters directly.
//!
//! Completion is contextual and prefix-matched only — no fuzzy
//! scoring and no Tab-to-cycle. The popup recomputes on every
//! keystroke, `↑`/`↓` move the highlight (falling back to command
//! history when the popup is empty), `Tab` accepts the highlighted
//! row, `Esc` dismisses the popup first and closes the console on a
//! second press.
//!
//! Visuals live in [`visuals`] — palette, glyphs, and scrollback
//! dimming constants. The renderer composes the border from
//! `baumhard::mindmap::border::BorderGlyphSet::box_drawing_rounded`
//! and clips content through
//! `baumhard::util::grapheme_chad::truncate_to_display_width` so
//! wide-char input never drifts past the right edge.
//!
//! Module layout:
//!
//! - [`parser`] — `tokenize`, `parse`, `Args` (incl. `kvs()` / `kv()`).
//! - [`predicates`] — applicability helpers (selection-shape queries).
//! - [`traits`] — `ColorValue`, the capability traits, `TargetView`,
//!   and the `apply_kvs` dispatcher.
//! - [`commands`] — the `COMMANDS` slice and per-command exec logic.
//! - [`completion`] — contextual completion engine.
//! - [`visuals`] — palette and glyph constants.
