//! Mutation-frequency throttle — the governing invariant in code.
//!
//! **Responsiveness is never traded for visual fidelity.** When per-frame
//! work threatens the screen refresh budget, we sacrifice how often we
//! *apply* mutations (and the rebuilds they drive), not how often we
//! *accept* input. Input accumulation stays running every tick; mutation
//! application is the valve this module turns.
//!
//! # Mechanism
//!
//! The drag path in `AboutToWait` calls [`should_drain`] each frame. On
//! `false`, the caller skips its heavy drain work and leaves its
//! accumulated state (`pending_delta`) intact — next tick will pick up
//! where this one left off, with more delta folded in from whatever
//! mouse events arrived in the meantime. On `true`, the caller runs the
//! work, times it with `Instant::now()`, and feeds the resulting
//! [`Duration`] back via [`record_work_duration`].
//!
//! The struct maintains a moving average over the last [`WINDOW_SIZE`]
//! drained frames. When the average exceeds the configured refresh
//! budget, `n` (the drain divisor) increments toward [`MAX_N`]. When the
//! average drops comfortably under budget, `n` decays back toward `1`.
//! The 30% hysteresis band between "raise" and "lower" thresholds
//! prevents oscillation on borderline frames.
//!
//! # Visual consequences
//!
//! With `n = 1` (the healthy steady state) the throttle is a no-op — the
//! drag runs every frame exactly as before. With `n > 1`, the dragged
//! node advances in chunks, catching up to the cursor every `n` frames.
//! On a 60 Hz display at `n = 4` the node updates every ~66ms, which is
//! perceptible but still clearly *tracking* — and the refresh rate
//! itself never drops, because the GPU swap chain keeps presenting
//! already-built buffers on the skipped frames. The cursor (hardware)
//! never lags at all.
//!
//! # Configuration
//!
//! Zero — the throttle is self-tuning. The only knob is the budget
//! passed at construction. Everything else (window size, max N,
//! hysteresis) is baked in.
