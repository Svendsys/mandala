//! `WindowEvent::MouseWheel` arm. Resolves the scroll direction to a
//! `MouseGesture`, looks up whatever the user has bound to it, and
//! runs that Action through the funnel — the same three steps native
//! takes. `WheelUp` / `WheelDown` are default-bound to `ZoomIn` /
//! `ZoomOut`; rebinding or unbinding them takes effect here.
//!
//! Pre-unification this arm hardcoded a 1.1× zoom factor, emitted the
//! `CameraZoom` decree itself, and rebuilt every canvas role
//! unconditionally — so a browser user's `keybinds.json` had no say
//! in what the wheel did.

        // rather than rebuilding unconditionally — is what keeps a
        // non-camera Action bound to the wheel from paying for a
        // scene reprojection it did not cause.
        //
        // Three things a reader of a *shared* body will otherwise
        // assume are identical at both call sites, and are not:
        //
        // 1. **Narrower than the browser's old behavior.** Base WASM
        //    ran `rebuild_scene_only` here — all seven canvas roles.
        //    `rebuild_camera_geometry` reprojects three (connections,
        //    connection labels, portals). The other four — borders,
        //    section frames, and both resize-handle trees — are
        //    canvas-space and zoom-independent, so a zoom cannot move
        //    them; native has always taken the narrow set through
        //    `drain_camera_geometry_rebuild`, and §4's mobile budget
        //    is the reason to converge on the narrow one rather than
        //    the wide one.
        // 2. **`CameraPan` does not set the flag** (`renderer/
        //    decree.rs`) — only `CameraZoom` does, because zoom is
        //    what changes the effective font size and therefore the
        //    sample spacing. So rebinding `WheelUp` to
        //    `PanCameraNorth` moves the camera with no reprojection
        //    at all. Native's drain has exactly the same shape, so
        //    "rebinding the wheel behaves identically on both
        //    targets" holds — this is the one input class where
        //    identical means identically incomplete.
        // 3. **No `!is_moving_node` term.** Native's drain guards
        //    with `geometry_dirty && !is_moving_node` so a
        //    mid-node-drag frame does not reproject. There is no
        //    equivalent here, and none is needed only because
        //    `WasmInputState` carries no `drag_state` yet. Whoever
        //    ports the drag machinery owns adding it.
