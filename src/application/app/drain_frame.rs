/// One rubber-band frame: move the overlay rectangle, re-hit-test,
/// and repaint the preview highlight **only if the covered set
/// changed**.
///
/// Two things used to happen here every frame, and neither has to.
///
/// The hit-test built a whole fresh arena (`doc.build_tree()`, a
/// §B7-benchmarked primitive) just to have something to hit-test
/// against. It does not need one: a rubber-band drag mutates
/// nothing, so the geometry `rect_select` reads is exactly the
/// geometry the installed tree already carries. The old code built
/// its own because it also needed a *clean* tree to stamp the
/// preview onto — the preview is an absolute `SetRegionColor` write
/// with no inverse, so the only way to move it was to start over.
///
/// The repaint then ran on every frame regardless. Now the covered
/// set lives on the document as
/// [`MindMapDocument::rect_select_preview`], where every rebuild
/// path reads it, and `set_rect_select_preview` reports whether the
/// set actually moved. A frame that only slid the rectangle without
/// crossing a node boundary — nearly all of them — calls neither
/// `build_tree` nor `rebuild_buffers_from_tree`.
///
/// Putting the preview on the document also closed a hole: an
/// animation tick landing mid-gesture runs its `rebuild_all` *after*
/// this drain in the same frame, and used to wipe the preview until
/// the next drain rebuilt it. It now paints the preview like every
/// other rebuild.
