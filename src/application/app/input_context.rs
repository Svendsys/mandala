//! Shared per-call context for the native event-loop dispatchers.
//!
//! Mouse, keyboard, cursor, and console-submit handlers each need
//! roughly the same bundle of mutable references into `InitState`:
//! the document, renderer, scene, modal-state machines, keybinds,
//! and so on. Before this module existed, every handler spelled the
//! bundle out as twenty separate function parameters and silenced
//! `clippy::too_many_arguments` over the top. That silencing is the
//! §6 smell this type closes.
//!
//! `InputHandlerContext<'a>` borrows each persistent field as
//! `&'a mut T` (or `&'a T` for read-only state); handlers destructure
//! the fields they need via `ctx.field`. Fields that are *per-event*
//! (button press state, key code, modifiers snapshot, cursor position
//! delivered by the event) stay as separate function parameters —
//! the context is about persistent state, not the event payload.
//!
//! Borrow-check-wise, a `&mut InputHandlerContext<'_>` lets a handler
//! take disjoint mutable field borrows under Rust's standard rules,
//! exactly as if the state lived in a single struct.
//!
//! The builder lives on `InitState::input_context` in
//! `src/application/app/run_native.rs`.
