//! The release half of a throttled drag's lifecycle: what each
//! gesture writes to the model when the button comes up, and what
//! it owes the canvas afterwards.
//!
//! Every release body does the same four things in the same order —
//! flush whatever the throttle left pending, commit the gesture to
//! the model (with its undo entry), clear the scene cache when the
//! per-frame drains left stale samples in it, and rebuild. Only the
//! first two are gesture-specific; the last two are a decree the
//! body *names* rather than performs, so the whole commit stays
//! renderer-free and therefore testable (TEST_CONVENTIONS §T8 keeps
//! live wgpu out of the harness). [`ReleaseRefresh::execute`] is the
//! shell that runs the decree.
