//! Unified shell for continuous, high-frequency-input-driven
//! mutations, covering the whole lifecycle of one:
//!
//! 1. **Accumulate** — [`ThrottledDragInteraction::accumulate`]
//!    folds a cursor sample into the gesture's pending state, per
//!    the discipline its [`ThrottledPending`] was built with.
//! 2. **Drain** — [`ThrottledInteraction::drive`] packages the
//!    has-pending → should-drain → record-duration dance around the
//!    per-gesture `drain` body.
//! 3. **Commit on release** —
//!    [`ThrottledDragInteraction::commit_on_release`] flushes what
//!    the throttle left pending, writes the model with its undo
//!    entry, and runs the canvas decree its renderer-free core hands
//!    back (see [`release`]).
//!
//! An implementor supplies four things: the accessor pair for its
//! [`ThrottledPending`], a `drain` body, and — if it is a drag — a
//! `commit_on_release` body. `has_pending`, `throttle`, `accumulate`
//! and the whole drive shell follow. Adding a new throttled drag is
//! one struct, one trait impl and one [`ThrottledDrag`] variant;
//! neither event-file dispatcher grows.
//!
//! Scope: drags and hover effects that fire a flood of cursor
//! events. One-shots and self-gated paths stay on their existing
//! call paths.
//!
//! The has-pending check before should_drain is load-bearing —
//! advancing the skip counter on an idle interaction would push
//! the first real drain out of cadence.
