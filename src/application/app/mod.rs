//! Application shell: winit event loop, modal state machines,
//! and the dispatch funnel that ties them together. [`Application`]
//! is the binary entry point's root; [`Application::run`]
//! transfers control to the per-target run loop
//! (`run_native` / `run_wasm`) which builds the appropriate
//! `ApplicationHandler` and hands it to winit. Both are plain
//! code-spans, not intra-doc links: each is `cfg`-gated to one
//! target and rustdoc resolves links against the *active*
//! target's module tree, so a link to either breaks the doc
//! build for the other target.
//!
//! **Dispatch funnel.** Every user-driven action — keyboard,
//! mouse-click, console verb, macro replay — flows through
//! `dispatch::dispatch_action` (CODE_CONVENTIONS §3) — a plain
//! code-span for the same reason: it is re-exported from the
//! native-gated `dispatch::native`, so the link does not resolve
//! on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Per-event
//! handlers (in `event_keyboard`, `event_mouse_click`,
//! `event_cursor_moved` on native; the per-arm methods of
//! `run_wasm::WasmApp` on WASM) recognize an input gesture,
//! resolve it to an [`crate::application::keybinds::Action`],
//! and call into the funnel. Adding a new behavior is
//! variant + default + arm, in that order; never inline a body
//! in a handler.
//!
//! **Modal state machines.** `text_edit`, `single_line_edit`,
//! `console_input`, and `color_picker_flow` steal keyboard input
//! when open (the §3 carve-out for modals that own the literal
//! `winit::Key` payload). Mouse handlers continue to run; modal
//! commit / cancel routes through `Action::TextEditCommit` /
//! `LabelEditCancel` etc. The two text editors share one steal /
//! release ladder in `modal_editor`.
//!
//! **Cross-platform shape.** Pure logic (gesture recognition,
//! viewport math, hit testing, `Action` resolution) lives in
//! `cfg`-untagged free functions so it compiles for both
//! native and WASM. The native vs. WASM divergence is largely
//! confined to the run-loop entry point; cross-platform
//! `Action` arms route through [`dispatch::action_core`]'s
//! `dispatch_compatible`. See `WASM_CONVERGENCE.md` for the
//! current convergence status.
