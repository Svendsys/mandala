//! Native-only main-loop watchdog. A background thread wakes
//! periodically and checks whether the main thread has pinged its
//! liveness atomic recently; if the main thread has been silent
//! longer than [`FREEZE_THRESHOLD`], the watchdog prints a
//! diagnostic banner and aborts the process.
//!
//! # Why it earns its keep
//!
//! Mandala is single-threaded by design (see `CLAUDE.md`'s
//! "Architectural shape" section). That invariant covers app state
//! — the model, the tree, the scene, the renderer — but it does not
//! protect against the app's main thread becoming permanently
//! blocked: a same-thread re-entrant `std::sync::RwLock` acquire
//! hangs forever, `surface.get_current_texture()` can block on some
//! wgpu backends under driver or compositor stalls, and a future
//! loop bug with no termination guard would do the same. Without a
//! watchdog, all of these present to the user as "the app froze"
//! with no stack trace, no log line, nothing actionable.
//!
//! The watchdog is deliberately minimal. It owns a single
//! [`AtomicU64`] holding the last ping's ms-since-start timestamp;
//! the main loop writes this atomic at the top of every
//! `AboutToWait` drain. The watchdog thread only ever *reads* that
//! atomic — it never touches any app state — so the single-threaded
//! invariant for app logic is preserved.
//!
//! # Not on WASM
//!
//! WASM builds do not get an equivalent in this pass. Browser tabs
//! surface their own "page unresponsive" dialog after a similar
//! threshold, and the JS event-loop machinery differs enough that a
//! Worker-based liveness check warrants its own design. The freeze
//! class this module diagnoses is also native-heavier: `RwLock`
//! deadlocks on wasm32 are caught earlier because the runtime is
//! cooperative, and the GPU path is mediated by the browser. See
//! `CLAUDE.md`'s "Dual-target status" for the parity note.
