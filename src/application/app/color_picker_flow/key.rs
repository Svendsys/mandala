//! Picker keystroke plumbing, split along the CODE_CONVENTIONS §3
//! line:
//!
//! - [`picker_op_for`] / [`PickerOp`] — the single source of truth
//!   for "the color picker owns this `Action`". Commit, cancel and
//!   the six nudges are user-named effects, so they belong in the
//!   dispatch funnel exactly like `TextEditCommit` /
//!   `LabelEditCommit`, and the funnel is what a
//!   `MacroStep::Action` reaches. The keyboard pre-filter
//!   (`event_keyboard.rs`), the click router ([`super::click`]) and
//!   the `dispatch_action` arm (`dispatch::native`) all read this
//!   one function, so an Action can never be routed toward the
//!   funnel without an arm there to receive it.
//! - [`apply_picker_nudge`] / [`nudged_hsv`] — the nudge primitive
//!   the funnel arm runs. Renderer-free, so the HSV math is
//!   directly testable.
//! - [`handle_color_picker_clipboard_key`] — what legitimately
//!   stays modal-local (CODE_CONVENTIONS §3 "modal steals"): the
//!   picker's Copy / Paste / Cut over the hex value, plus the
//!   fall-through verdict for every other key.
