//! `compute_picker_geometry` — the pre-rebuild pass that turns the
//! state's HSV + measurement values into a
//! `ColorPickerOverlayGeometry`, runs the pure-function layout, and
//! reports whether the layout changed since the last rebuild so the
//! dispatcher can pick between the layout-phase and dynamic-phase
//! mutators.

/// Build geometry from the current picker state and report whether
/// the layout has changed since the previous call. Internal helper —
/// the bool lets `rebuild_color_picker_overlay` pick between the
/// layout-phase mutator (full per-cell field set; viewport resize,
/// RMB drag-to-resize, drag-to-move repositioning) and the cheaper
/// dynamic-phase mutator (color + hover scale + hex text only). Also
/// caches the freshly-computed `ColorPickerLayout` back into the
/// state so the mouse hit-test can read it without re-running the
/// layout pure fn.
///
/// The "first call after open" case (no cached layout yet) reports
/// `changed = true` so the layout phase fires once before any
/// dynamic frames land — without it the dynamic mutator would only
/// write the per-frame fields onto a tree whose static fields are
/// still at their initial-build values, which is correct on this
/// path (the initial build IS the layout phase) but the bool keeps
/// the dispatch readable.
///
/// Takes `surface_size` as a plain `(width, height)` tuple in pixels
/// rather than a `&Renderer`: per `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md §3`, platform-
/// shared layout math must be reachable without a wgpu instance, and
/// the pure layout fn `compute_color_picker_layout` only needs the
/// two screen dimensions.
