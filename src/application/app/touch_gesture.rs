//! `TouchGestureRecognizer` — the touch half of the pointer
//! vocabulary, as a plain-value state machine.
//!
//! The rest of the input pipeline is mouse-first: both targets
//! consume `WindowEvent::MouseInput` / `CursorMoved` / `MouseWheel`
//! and route them through the dispatch funnel via the
//! [`crate::application::keybinds::MouseGesture`] table. A finger
//! arrives instead as `WindowEvent::Touch`, and winit's mouse
//! synthesis does not cover a hold, a second finger, or a drag that
//! never pressed a button — so without this module a phone in the
//! browser has no input path at all, on the surface
//! `run_wasm/mod.rs` calls the *primary* one this project targets.
//!
//! What the machine consumes is raw `(phase, finger_id, position,
//! now)` tuples; what it produces is a [`RecognizedGesture`]. No
//! clock is read in here and no I/O happens in here — time arrives
//! as a parameter — which is what makes every rule below provable
//! by `cargo test` on a machine with no touchscreen
//! (`TEST_CONVENTIONS §T9`).
//!
//! ## The vocabulary, and where each emission goes
//!
//! Four gestures, in two groups that reach the application by two
//! different routes (`dispatch::cross_dispatch::pointer`):
//!
//! - [`RecognizedGesture::LongPress`] is **keybind-routed**: the
//!   runtime resolves `MouseGesture::LongPress` through
//!   `action_for_gesture` and dispatches whatever `Action` the user
//!   has bound, exactly as a mouse gesture does.
//! - [`RecognizedGesture::Tap`], [`RecognizedGesture::Pan`] and
//!   [`RecognizedGesture::PinchStep`] are **direct-effect**: they
//!   take the two carve-outs `CODE_CONVENTIONS §3` already grants
//!   the mouse. A tap commits a selection, which is the
//!   "pre-funnel state-machine bookkeeping" carve-out that a
//!   single left-click takes; a pan or a pinch moves the camera by
//!   a `RenderDecree`, which is the "per-frame continuous-gesture
//!   state" carve-out that a left-drag's per-cursor-move delta
//!   takes. Neither becomes an `Action`, so neither can be dead on
//!   one target the way a `NativeOnly` binding is.
//!

//!
//! Four emit points, and the rules that keep them from overlapping:
//!
//! - **`LongPress`** fires from [`TouchGestureRecognizer::tick`] —
//!   "held for 350 ms" is a wall-clock transition, not an event —
//!   once per `OneFinger` episode, and only while the finger has
//!   stayed inside
//!   [`POINTER_DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX`](super::POINTER_DRAG_THRESHOLD_PX).
//! - **`Tap`** fires on the finger's lift, and only when the
//!   episode has emitted nothing else, the finger never left the
//!   threshold, and the hold was *shorter* than the long-press
//!   budget. The two time windows are disjoint at the boundary:
//!   `tick` fires at `>= long_press`, a tap needs `< long_press`.
//! - **`Pan`** fires on every `Moved` from the sample that crosses
//!   the threshold onward. That first emission carries the travel
//!   since the finger *landed*, not since the previous sample, so
//!   the canvas ends up displaced by exactly the finger's net
//!   displacement and the threshold slop is not silently lost.
//! - **`PinchStep`** fires while two fingers are down, whenever
//!   *either* their midpoint has travelled past the threshold or
//!   their separation has changed past it, measured from the
//!   previous emission. Both halves are reported every time, so a
//!   two-finger gesture that is really a translation reports
//!   `scale == 1.0`, and one that is really a spread reports a
//!   near-zero `pan`.
//!
//! ## Why a typed emission rather than a synthetic mouse event
//!
//! A literal "synthesise `(ElementState, MouseButton)` and call the
//! mouse handler" would make the dispatch funnel see
//! `MouseButton::Left` rather than the gesture, so a long-press
//! would run the left-click binding. Emitting the recognized
//! gesture instead leaves the recognition as the only new step; the
//! routing beyond it is the machinery each of the two groups above
//! already had.
