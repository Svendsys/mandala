//! `TouchGestureRecognizer` — touch input parity for mouse
//! gestures (`SECTIONS_BORDERS_RESIZE_PLAN.md` §6.6 / Batch 7).
//!
//! Today's input pipeline is mouse-first: native and WASM both
//! consume `WindowEvent::MouseInput` / `CursorMoved` / `MouseWheel`
//! and route them through the dispatch funnel via the
//! [`crate::application::keybinds::MouseGesture`] table. Touch
//! events on a phone or tablet arrive via `WindowEvent::Touch`
//! (winit) and were dropped silently — the existing comment in
//! `run_wasm/mod.rs:454-461` flagged the gap.
//!
//! This module implements the recogniser the plan calls for: a
//! pure state machine fed raw `(phase, finger_id, position, now)`
//! tuples from the runtime that emits a typed
//! [`RecognizedGesture`] when one of the supported touch
//! gestures fires. The runtime translates each emission into
//! the same `MouseGesture::*` dispatch the mouse path uses, so
//! the keybind table doesn't grow a parallel touch surface —
//! a `LongPress` and a synthetic right-click run the same
//! `Action`.
//!
//! ## State machine
//!

//!
//! `Idle ↔ OneFinger ↔ TwoFingers` with two emit points: the
//! long-press timer (fires once per OneFinger episode at
//! `started_at + LONG_PRESS_MS` if no movement past
//! `MOVE_THRESHOLD_PX`); the two-finger-drag movement check
//! (fires every frame while in TwoFingers and the centroid has
//! moved past `MOVE_THRESHOLD_PX` since the last emission).
//!
//! ## Why a typed-emission API rather than synthetic mouse events
//!
//! The plan's §6.6 sketch reads "emits `MouseGesture::*` synthetic
//! events into the existing mouse-input pipeline". A literal
//! reading would have the recogniser construct
//! `(ElementState, MouseButton)` tuples and call
//! `event_mouse_click::handle_mouse_input` directly. The downside:
//! the dispatch funnel sees `MouseButton::Left`, not
//! `MouseGesture::LongPress`, so a long-press would dispatch the
//! `LeftClick` binding — wrong.
//!
//! Instead the recogniser emits a [`RecognizedGesture`] with the
//! resolved [`crate::application::keybinds::MouseGesture`]
//! variant + cursor pos. The runtime then runs the same lookup
//! path the click handlers do — `key_name() →
//! action_for_gesture` → `dispatch_action`. The recognition is
//! the only new step; the dispatch chain is unchanged.
