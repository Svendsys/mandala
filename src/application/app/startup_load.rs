//! What the shell does with the initial map load — the one answer
//! both targets use.
//!
//! Startup is the surface most likely to be a user's first contact
//! with the format, and it used to be the only one that swallowed a
//! loader error: the console `open` verb puts the message in the
//! overlay, `maptool` puts it on `stderr` and exits nonzero, and
//! startup logged it and rendered an empty canvas. On a desktop
//! launch — double-click, `.desktop` entry, file association — no
//! terminal is attached, so that log line does not exist for the
//! person who needs it.
//!
//! The answer is a *document*: a rejected load becomes the
//! [`baumhard::mindmap::placard`] map, which the shell then installs
//! exactly as it installs a real one. The consequences are the point
//! of doing it this way — the window opens, the canvas has content,
//! the camera fits it, input works, and the console (native) can
//! `open` something else without restarting. None of that needed a
//! new render path, and none of it needs a GPU to test.
//!
//! ## One call per target, taking only the source
//!
//! `native_startup_document` and `wasm_startup_document` are the
//! whole surface. Each takes the path or URL and returns the document
//! to install; neither hands its caller a `Result` to look at. That
//! is deliberate and it is the part worth defending: while the init
//! sites composed the load themselves, the loader's message passed
//! through their hands, and blanking it on the browser leg alone was
//! a one-line change that left every test green and put a placard
//! with an empty diagnosis on the canvas. There is now no `Result` at
//! either init site to intercept.
//!
//! What stays browser-only is `fetch_map_json` and the two-line
//! `wasm_startup_document` wrapper — `cargo test` runs the native
//! leg only (`TEST_CONVENTIONS.md` §T9), and `wasm-bindgen-test` is
//! not a tool this repo has (§T10), so neither can be reached at
//! runtime from here. The composition between them is therefore
//! lifted into [`browser_load`], which is target-independent,
//! compiled on native and tested there against the exact error
//! strings the fetch produces.
//!
//! The residue is pinned against the source, **in this file**:
//! `test_the_browser_entry_point_adds_nothing_of_its_own` holds
//! `wasm_startup_document`'s two statements by *equality*, and
//! `test_the_fetch_returns_a_real_diagnosis_that_never_names_the_url`
//! reads `fetch_map_json`'s messages out of its own body. Both were
//! once claimed for `test_both_targets_go_through_one_startup_call`,
//! which reads the two *init* files and never opens this one — so the
//! privacy of [`StartupSurface`] closed the init sites while the
//! module's own browser leg stayed open, and blanking the URL one
//! level in was still a one-line change under a green suite.
