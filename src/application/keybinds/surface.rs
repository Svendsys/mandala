//! The keybind **declaration surface**: the machinery behind the one
//! table in [`super::config`] that declares how every [`Action`]
//! reaches `keybinds.json`.
//!
//! ## Why this exists
//!
//! A bindable Action used to be declared in three hand-synced places
//! — a [`super::KeybindConfig`] struct field, a `Default` entry, and a
//! row in `resolve()`. A field missing from `resolve()` compiled
//! cleanly and the binding was silently dead, which is a bug that had
//! already shipped more than once (`Action::SetBorderPreview` had a
//! field and no row; `Action::CycleBorderPreset` and
//! `Action::ToggleBorderVisible` documented themselves as bindable
//! and had neither).
//!
//! [`keybind_surface!`] collapses the three into one row per Action
//! and makes the fourth thing — *did you decide at all?* — a compile
//! error: alongside the struct, the `Default` impl and the resolve
//! step, the macro emits a `match` over every `ActionKind`, and the
//! recognized-key set that the loader's unknown-key warning consults
//! is built by walking that match. A new `Action` variant that
//! appears in no section of the table fails the match's
//! exhaustiveness check, in an ordinary `cargo build`.
//!
//! ## The two binding surfaces
//!
//! - **Simple** — a `Vec<String>` of key combos, for unit variants:
//!   `"undo": ["Ctrl+Z", "Undo"]`.
//! - **Parametric** — a `Vec<ParametricBinding>`, for payload-carrying
//!   variants: `"set_color": [{ "combo": "F1", "args": ["bg", "#fafafa"] }]`.
//!
//! Which surface a variant lands on is not a choice: the `simple`
//! section names the variant with no payload, so listing a
//! payload-carrying variant there does not compile, and the
//! `parametric` section requires at least one payload field. Unit
//! variants therefore always take the ergonomic string-list form and
//! payload variants always take the args form.
//!
//! ## Payload conversion
//!
//! Positional `args` reach the variant's fields through [`ArgValue`]:
//! `String` fields take the argument verbatim, typed fields
//! ([`ColorAxis`], [`FontSlot`], ...) go through their strum-derived
//! `FromStr`. A field whose type has no `ArgValue` impl does not
//! compile, which is the seam a new typed payload extends —
//! `impl_arg_value_via_from_str!` takes the type name and nothing
//! else.
