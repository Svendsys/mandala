//! `KeybindConfig` — the user-editable config surface, its JSON
//! loader, and the `resolve()` step that produces the runtime
//! `ResolvedKeybinds` table.
//!
//! **The struct is generated.** Everything a bindable
//! [`Action`] needs on the config side — the struct field, its
//! default, its row in the resolve step, and its arm in the
//! `ActionKind` → JSON-key match — comes from the one
//! [`keybind_surface!`] table below. That is the whole point of the
//! module: the three used to be hand-synced, a field missing from
//! `resolve()` compiled, and the binding was silently dead. See
//! [`super::surface`] for the machinery and for what a new variant
//! now costs (a compile error until it appears in the table).
//!
//! What stays hand-written here is what is not per-Action: the JSON
//! entry point, the unrecognized-key report, and the tail of
//! `resolve()` that folds in the id-keyed custom-mutation and macro
//! binding maps.
