/// for each per-frame intent the renderer should react to; the
/// renderer drains them at frame start. Everything that
/// changes GPU state without changing document state goes
/// through here so the model/view boundary (§3) stays clean.
///
/// Variants:
/// - `Noop` — default sentinel; never actually queued by the
///   event loop, but `RenderDecree::default() = Noop` lets
///   builders compile.
/// - `SetFpsDisplay(mode)` — flip the on-screen FPS readout
///   between off / snapshot / debug. See [`FpsDisplayMode`].
/// - `StartRender` — open the per-frame draw gate. Both targets
///   send it once, from their init path, after the first scene
///   is built; the renderer draws nothing before it.
/// - `SetSurfaceSize(w, h)` — propagate a winit `Resized` to
///   the wgpu surface configuration.
/// - `Terminate` — release GPU resources before the event loop
///   exits.
/// - `CameraPan(dx, dy)` — translate the camera origin by a
///   per-cursor-move delta in canvas pixels (the §3 carve-out
///   for per-frame continuous-gesture state).
/// - `CameraZoom { screen_x, screen_y, factor }` — multiply
///   the camera zoom by `factor`, anchored at the given screen
///   coordinates so the point under the cursor stays put.
