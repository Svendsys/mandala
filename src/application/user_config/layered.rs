//! The layered-fallback driver every user-tier config loader runs on.
//!
//! Each user-tier config (`keybinds.json`, `mutations.json`,
//! `macros.json`) is looked up across an ordered list of candidate
//! sources — explicit CLI path before the XDG path on native,
//! `localStorage` alone on web — and the first source that yields a
//! payload which fits the size cap *and* parses wins.
//! A source that is simply absent is skipped silently; a source that
//! is present but unreadable, oversized, or malformed is logged and
//! the walk continues. That policy is identical for every config and
//! every platform, so it lives here exactly once.
//!
//! The driver itself is platform-neutral: it only knows how to walk
//! [`ConfigLayer`]s. The filesystem-backed layers are built by
//! `super::desktop::load_desktop_layered` on top of
//! `super::read_capped`; the `localStorage` layer is built by
//! `super::web_storage::load_web_storage_only`, and the query-param
//! layer beside it in `super::web_storage::load_web_layered` is built
//! and reached by nothing, for the trust reason that module's header
//! gives. Both of those wrappers are cfg-gated to their target, so
//! this header names them in plain backticks rather than intra-doc
//! links. That split keeps the precedence logic testable on native
//! (TEST_CONVENTIONS §T9) even though half the layers only exist in a
//! browser.
