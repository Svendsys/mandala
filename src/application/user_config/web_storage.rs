//! WASM-side `localStorage` access, plus the `?<name>=` query-param
//! reader that nothing calls. The three user-tier JSON loaders
//! (keybinds, mutations, macros) all reach for the same shape: read
//! a named `localStorage` key, or fall back to their defaults. Same
//! shape; same machinery — [`load_web_storage_only`] is that shape,
//! wired onto the shared [`super::layered::load_layered`] driver.
//!
//! **The query-param layer is built but not reached.** All three
//! browser loaders (`keybinds::platform_web`,
//! `macros::loader::platform_web`,
//! `document::mutations_loader::platform_web`) call
//! [`load_web_storage_only`], so [`load_web_layered`] — the
//! two-layer chain that would read `?keybinds=<json>` and its
//! siblings before `localStorage` — does nothing today. #41 found
//! the chain dead and kept it rather than delete a working
//! implementation: switching the three call sites over is a decision
//! about what URL surface the app offers, not a cleanup, and
//! [`load_web_storage_only`] carries the trust argument for why the
//! answer is currently no. Until then this module holds a capability
//! the app does not have, and that is recorded here rather than left
//! for the next reader to discover.
