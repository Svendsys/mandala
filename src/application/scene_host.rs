//! `AppScene` owns Baumhard `Scene` sub-scenes plus role-keyed slots
//! for the canvas trees (borders, connections, portals, edge handles,

//!
//! It is also the app's hit-test entry point for tree-rendered

//! `portal_at` / `edge_label_at` resolve canvas-space clicks on the
//! interactive canvas roles by running Baumhard's BVH over the very
//! tree that produced the pixels, then naming the hit through the
//! role's identity index. There is one spatial index for canvas
//! content — the per-tree BVH — and no side table of rectangles.
