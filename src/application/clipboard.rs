//! Platform clipboard abstraction. Native uses `arboard`; WASM is a
//! logged stub pending an async-browser integration.
//!
//! Also owns the in-process **structured section buffer**: the OS
//! clipboard carries the plain section text (so cross-app paste
//! sees something sensible); a thread-local single-slot buffer
//! carries the full `SectionPayload` so within-app section→section
//! paste round-trips per-run formatting and section chrome.
//! Read consults the buffer only when the probe text matches the
//! buffer's snapshot — guards against the user copying from
//! another app between Mandala copy and paste.
//!
//! Thread-local rather than a `static Mutex<…>` because the
//! editor's event loop is single-threaded; each parallel `cargo
//! test` worker also gets its own slot, which removes the
//! cross-thread race a global would otherwise have.
