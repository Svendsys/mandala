//! The app-side execution context a command handler drives the
//! application through (`work_plans/LLM_IPC.md` §D5 "Crossing the
//! `app` boundary").
//!
//! The funnels a command reaches are `dispatch_action`,
//! `dispatch_macro` and `execute_console_line`. They are private to
//! `crate::application::app`, and this module is that module's
//! sibling. So `app` implements [`CommandTarget`] over the same
//! `InputHandlerContext` an input handler receives and passes it in
//! as `&mut dyn`. `MacroDispatchTarget` uses the same indirection,
//! and it keeps both the funnels private and this module free of
//! `app` internals.
//!
//! **The trait adds no route around a gate.** Each method is one of
//! the existing funnels and nothing else. A future command that
//! needs a path past a privilege gate is a redesign of `format/ipc.md`
//! §Trust model, not a new method here (§D4's composition rule).
