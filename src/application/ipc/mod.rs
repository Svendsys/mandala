//! Local inter-process control: the socket an external process — an
//! LLM agent, a test harness, `mandalactl` — drives the running app
//! through. The wire contract is `format/ipc.md`; the design and its
//! rejected alternatives are `work_plans/LLM_IPC.md`.
//!
//! **The boundary contract** (CODE_CONVENTIONS §3, "Sanctioned
//! boundary threads"). Opt-in per launch with `--ipc <path>`; without
//! the flag nothing in this module runs. With it, dedicated threads
//! own the socket and move *protocol values* — decoded requests,
//! frames to encode — across `std::sync::mpsc`; they never see
//! `InitState`, the document or the renderer. Every command executes
//! on the main thread, between winit events, with the same access an
//! input handler has, so IPC never races the user and a command's
//! effects are ordered with theirs. The threads wake the parked event
//! loop through a winit user event ([`IpcWake`]), which is what lets
//! an idle app — parked in `ControlFlow::Wait`, the state an agent
//! most often finds it in — answer with no polling and no idle cost.
//!
//! Native-only at this module boundary, the `console_input`
//! precedent: browsers cannot serve local sockets (`CLAUDE.md`
//! "Dual-target status"). Within native, the transport is Unix-only
//! until the Windows named-pipe adapter lands; until then `--ipc` on
//! Windows fails at startup rather than doing nothing.

// The envelope is transport-agnostic, but the only code that reads
// what it builds is the Unix transport. Off Unix the module compiles
// with nothing draining it — the same shape as the wasm32 allows in
// `application/mod.rs`, scoped the same way so the Unix lint stays
// fully armed, and gone when the named-pipe transport (#169) lands.
