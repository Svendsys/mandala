//! The Unix-socket transport: the boundary threads that own the
//! socket, and [`IpcServer`], the main thread's handle onto them.
//!
//! **Who owns what** (`work_plans/LLM_IPC.md` §D2). A persistent
//! *acceptor* always waits in `accept()`, so a second client learns it
//! is refused at once. Each controller connection gets a *reader*
//! (bytes → lines → [`IpcRequest`]s) and an *outbound* writer
//! (frames → bytes), spawned together and torn down together. None of
//! them sees `InitState`, the document or the renderer; they exchange
//! protocol values with the main thread over `std::sync::mpsc` and
//! wake it through the closure [`IpcServer::start`] is handed — a
//! winit `EventLoopProxy` send in the app.
//!
//! **One ordered queue in.** Requests *and* the controller lifecycle
//! notices (connected, gone) travel on the same FIFO, so the main
//! thread sees them in the order they happened. That is what makes
//! the generation stamp exact: a request is executed only while its
//! controller is the live one, a controller's requests are always
//! seen after its `Connected` and before its `Gone`, and a client
//! that sends a request and then closes its write half still gets
//! every reply (the classic `printf … | nc -U` round trip), because
//! its `Gone` cannot overtake its requests. The request cap is
//! counted separately so lifecycle notices are never refused.
//!
//! **Nothing blocks the main thread.** Delivery to a controller is a
//! `try_send` into its bounded outbound queue. A full queue does not
//! mean the client is gone — the main thread can execute a burst of
//! pipelined requests faster than the writer thread is scheduled to
//! drain them, even though the writer sends everything queued in one
//! write — so it *pauses* that controller instead: the reply that did not fit
//! is held, no further request is executed, and the outbound thread
//! wakes the loop as soon as it has made room. A client that has
//! genuinely stopped reading is detected where it can be, at the
//! socket: a write that cannot make progress for
//! `STALLED_WRITE_TIMEOUT` ends the connection (`format/ipc.md`
//! §Threading contract). The only bounded wait on the main thread is
//! at exit, after the event loop has stopped, for the `shutdown` event
//! to flush.
