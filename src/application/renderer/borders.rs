/// Widest shaped advance across `glyphs` at `font_size`, via
/// cosmic-text. Falls back to `monospace_advance(font_size)` if
/// every glyph shapes to zero (tofu + missing fallback).
///
/// Each cluster is measured through
/// [`baumhard::font::metric_cache::glyph_advance_with`], the crate's
/// one `(face, size, cluster) → advance` cache, rather than through
/// a scratch `Buffer` per call. The console rebuild path asks for
/// the same two box-drawing clusters at the same size on every
/// keystroke; with the cache that pass shapes them once for the
/// process instead of once per rebuild. The `_with` variant is
/// mandatory here — every caller already holds the `FONT_SYSTEM`
/// write guard, and a nested acquire is a self-deadlock (§B5).
///
/// The face pin is `None`, matching the bare `Attrs::new()` this
/// used to shape with: cosmic-text's default fallback face.
///
/// One semantic correction rides along. Each entry of `glyphs` is a
/// cluster, and a cluster can lay out as more than one glyph (a
/// Devanagari base plus its matra, say). The scratch-buffer version
/// took the widest *layout glyph* inside the cluster, which
/// under-measures such a cluster by everything after its first
/// glyph; the cache returns the cluster's summed advance, which is
/// the width it actually occupies. Single-glyph clusters — the
/// console's two box-drawing characters, and every entry of the
/// picker's tables that shapes to one glyph — are unaffected,
/// because for them the sum and the max are the same number. The
/// `max` in the name is the max *across* `glyphs`, which is
/// unchanged.
