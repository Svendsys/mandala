//! Per-element re-shape cache shared by both scene passes — the
//! screen-space overlay sub-scene and the camera-transformed canvas
//! sub-scene.
//!
//! Both sub-scenes of
//! [`AppScene`](crate::application::scene_host::AppScene) are
//! re-walked after every change to any of their trees. Walking them
//! is cheap; *shaping* them is not — every walked `GlyphArea` used to
//! get a fresh `cosmic_text::Buffer`, a `set_rich_text` and a
//! `shape_until_scroll`, times `halos + 1`, under one `FONT_SYSTEM`
//! write guard, at mouse-move cadence. A picker hover changes one
//! cell's color; a console keystroke changes one line's text; an
//! edge-label drag moves one label. None of those is a reason to
//! re-shape the other fifty-odd elements, or the other seven canvas
//! roles.
//!
//! ## The reuse rule, and why it needs no notifications
//!
//! This cache does **not** subscribe to a dirty signal. It keeps,
//! per shaped element, a verbatim copy of every input the shaper
//! read, and re-validates against the live tree on each pass. An
//! element's output is reused only when all of the following still
//! hold at the same position in the walk:
//!
//! - the same tree ([`SceneTreeId`]),
//! - the same `GfxElement::unique_id`,
//! - the same registered tree offset (the walker adds it to every
//!   emitted buffer's `pos` and to the fill rect's `position`),
//! - a `GlyphArea` equal to the stored one — or, for an element that
//!   carries no area, still no area.
//!
//! That list is exactly what [`shape_one_element_into_buffers`]
//! reads: `element.glyph_area()`, `element.unique_id()`, and its
//! `offset` argument. Nothing else reaches the emitted buffers — or
//! the background fill, which
//! [`extract_background_rect`](super::tree_walker::extract_background_rect)
//! derives from `background_color`, `background_padding`,
//! `position`, `render_bounds`, `shape` and `zoom_visibility` of the
//! same area plus the same `unique_id` and `offset`.
//!
//! The consequence worth naming: because the check compares against
//! live state rather than trusting a producer to announce itself,
//! **a new writer of scene-tree state cannot make this cache go
//! stale by forgetting to notify it**. A mutator apply, a
//! `Scene::tree_mut` escape-hatch write, a full re-register — all of
//! them are seen the same way, as a `GlyphArea` that no longer
//! compares equal. That is what answers the canvas pass's ten
//! `flush_canvas_scene_buffers` call sites as a class rather than
//! one at a time: each of them mutates registered canvas trees and
//! then flushes, and whatever it wrote is what the next walk reads.
//! A caller that touched no tree at all re-shapes nothing; a caller
//! that re-registered one role re-shapes the elements of that role
//! whose shaping inputs actually moved.
//!
//! `GlyphArea`'s `PartialEq` is derived, so a field added to the
//! area joins the comparison by default rather than by anyone
//! remembering to wire it in. "By default" and not "always": the
//! derive is `derivative`'s, and a field carrying
//! `#[derivative(PartialEq = "ignore")]` opts back out — exactly
//! what `hitbox`, the one field skipped today, does. So the
//! ignore-list is pinned rather than trusted:
//! `test_glyph_area_equality_ignores_only_the_hitbox` destructures
//! `GlyphArea` exhaustively and asserts every other field breaks
//! `==`, which fails both on a new field nobody classified and on
//! an `ignore` added to an existing one. `hitbox` itself is on the
//! ignored side because the shaper never reads it.
//!
//! ## The one place `==` is not enough
//!
//! `GlyphArea`'s derived equality bottoms out, for the `regions`
//! field, in `BTreeSet` equality over `ColorFontRegion` — whose own
//! `Eq` is *set identity by range*, ignoring the font and color
//! pins. So `area_a == area_b` is true for two areas whose spans
//! are painted different colors, which is precisely what a
//! color-picker hover changes and nothing else. Comparing on `==`
//! alone would have reused every cell's buffers through a hover and
//! frozen the wheel's colors on screen. The reuse check therefore
//! adds
//! [`ColorFontRegions::same_content`](baumhard::core::primitives::ColorFontRegions::same_content),
//! the content-equality question that type now answers, on top of
//! `==`.
//!
//! The one input outside that set is the font database itself, which
//! `RegionFamilies::resolve` and cosmic-text's shaper both consult.
//! It is loaded once, by `fonts::load_fonts` behind a `lazy_static`,
//! and never mutated again — `db_mut` has exactly one call site in
//! the workspace — so it cannot invalidate a cached buffer at
//! runtime. A future runtime font load would have to clear this
//! cache, and this paragraph exists to tell whoever writes one.
//!
//! ## Draw order across a partial re-shape
//!
//! Each entry owns its own output — its buffers *and* its fill —
//! and entries sit in walk order, so re-shaping one element writes
//! back into the position that element already occupied. That is
//! what keeps the two order-sensitive draw streams stable while
//! only part of the scene re-shapes: `render.rs` pushes one quad per
//! fill into a single vertex stream, so a later fill paints over an
//! earlier one, and text areas are handed to glyphon in the same
//! order for the same reason.
//!
//! The mindmap's own keyed re-shape had to solve this the other way
//! round, because its fills live in one flat list keyed by element
//! rather than grouped by walk position: `reshape_buffer_for` drops
//! an element's fill and re-inserts it at the index the old one held
//! (see [`BackgroundRectSlot`](super::tree_buffers::BackgroundRectSlot)),
//! having first shipped the version that appended and floated the
//! element being edited above every other node's fill. Grouping by
//! walk position is that hazard's structural answer rather than its
//! bookkeeping one — there is no removal for an insertion point to
//! be lost across.
//!
//! Two functions carry that order to the render pass, and between
//! them they decide it for **all four** order-sensitive streams:
//! [`background_fills`] for the rect pipeline, and [`text_buffers`]
//! for each of the two glyphon passes. `text_buffers` carries a
//! second ordering besides the one between elements — the walker
//! emits an element's halo stamps before the glyph they ring, so
//! that the glyph draws on top — which makes its inner order
//! load-bearing too.
//!
//! Both are pinned **absolutely**, by
//! `test_the_draw_streams_come_out_in_walk_order` and
//! `test_the_text_stream_puts_every_halo_stamp_before_the_glyph_it_rings`,
//! and the reason they have to be — rather than the comparison a
//! reuse cache invites — is worth stating instead of rediscovering.
//! That comparison is "a partial pass produces what a full one
//! does", and
//! `test_canvas_partial_reshape_matches_a_full_one_stream_for_stream`
//! makes it; it catches a per-entry difference the in-place path
//! introduces. What it cannot catch is a reordering these two
//! functions apply *uniformly*, because it reads both of its sides
//! through them — a comparison between two runs of one reader can
//! only see what the reader is not doing to both. Before the two
//! absolute assertions existed, reversing either function left that
//! test and every other test in the workspace green; they are what
//! closed that, and the boundary is recorded here because it is a
//! property of the comparison's *shape* and will hold again for the
//! next assertion built that way.
//!
//! The reuse rule is pinned by
//! `test_scene_shape_cache_invalidates_on_every_writable_area_field`
//! and its neighbors in `renderer::tests`.
