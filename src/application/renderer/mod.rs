//! GPU-side presentation: every wgpu device, every cosmic-text

//! representations the document layer hands it
//! (`Tree<GfxElement, GfxMutator>` for canvas content,
//! `Scene` for connection / portal / label overlays); it never

//!
//! The submodule split corresponds to wgpu pipeline boundaries:
//!
//! - [`pipeline`] — the small `RenderPipeline` factory shared
//!   across every text + rect pass.
//! - [`render`] — the per-frame `RenderPass` driver
//!   (`Renderer::process`); composes the buffer layers in
//!   draw order.
//! - [`tree_buffers`] / [`tree_walker`] — `GfxElement` tree
//!   → text-buffer + rect-buffer projection. The tree walker
//!   is where the bulk of canvas-content shaping happens.
//! - [`scene_buffers`] — connection paths, edge handles,
//!   portal markers, edge labels. Scene-graph projection.
//! - [`borders`] — node-frame buffers (the box-drawing
//!   glyph runs around each node).
//! - [`console_pass`] / [`console_geometry`] — the console
//!   overlay's glyph-tree pass + pure-function layout math.
//! - [`color_picker`] — the glyph-wheel picker overlay.
//! - [`hit`] — screen-space → canvas-space hit math
//!   (`screen_to_canvas`, `canvas_to_screen`, AABB resolution).
//! - [`decree`] — the `RenderDecree` queue the event loop
//!   feeds the renderer (resize, zoom, camera-pan, etc.).
//! - [`overlay_dispatch`] — overlay-vs-canvas slot routing
//!   for the [`crate::application::scene_host::AppScene`]
