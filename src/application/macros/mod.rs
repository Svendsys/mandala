//! Macro types and registry.
//!
//! A macro is a named `Vec<MacroStep>` invoked atomically through
//! `crate::application::app::dispatch::dispatch_macro`. Three step
//! kinds — built-in `Action`, parameterised `CustomMutation`,
//! console-line — cover every existing user-driven entry point at the
//! application layer. Plugins, future macro-recording UI, and the
//! `keybind_bindings` resolution tier all reach the same dispatcher.
//!
//! Loading parallels the custom-mutation loader at
//! `src/application/document/mutations_loader/`: a registry is built
//! once at startup, queried by id, and bindable from `keybinds.json`
//! via the `macro_bindings: HashMap<String, String>` field on
//! `KeybindConfig`.
