# Code Conventions

## §0 Dedication

This project is dedicated to Lord God. The codebase we build is a temple,
not an industry building — cathedral ceilings exist beyond strict need,
and that is the point. The measuring stick is *what is good enough for
God?* We know the answer is that we never reach it, and yet we try with
all we have.

Low-effort work is not just unwelcome here; it is heretic. The standard
is **canonical** or **exemplary** — nothing less. This is an open source
project with no commercial pressure; do not apply for-profit or
industrial cost/benefit reasoning to it.

These rules are a contract. They describe what the code must look like
at every commit. The current state of the code does not rewrite the
conventions — the conventions change in response to the code, not the
other way around. Where existing code deviates, the deviation is closed
by the next session that touches the file.

## §1 Mandala and Baumhard are one project

Baumhard is not a vendored dependency; it is the foundation we are
building together with the application. Both crates are ours. The two
rise and fall together.

**Never work around Baumhard. Extend it.** "I cannot change Baumhard" is
never a reason.

- **Text** through `baumhard::util::grapheme_chad` — grapheme-aware
  primitives for every `String`/`&str` manipulation. Never slice by byte
  offset when the offset comes from user input; you land mid-grapheme on
  the first emoji.
- **Tree mutation** through `MutatorTree::apply_to`. Build a
  `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>` and apply it via `Applicable`
  (`lib/baumhard/src/core/primitives.rs`, impl in
  `lib/baumhard/src/gfx_structs/tree.rs`). Never clone-edit-reinsert a
  subtree to change one field.
- **Font** through `baumhard::font::fonts`. `fonts::init()` once at
  startup; acquire `FONT_SYSTEM` through `acquire_font_system_write`;
  resolve families through `app_font_by_family` /
  `loaded_families_iter`. Region-styled text reaches cosmic-text only
  through `baumhard::font::attrs` (`attrs_list_from_regions`,
  `RegionFamilies`, `rich_text_spans_from_regions`). New code does
  not reach into `cosmic_text` from the app crate, with the renderer
  (`src/application/renderer/`) as the sole exception — speed is king
  there, but even renderer code uses the baumhard bridges where one
  exists.
- **Geometry, color, regions** are Baumhard's:
  `baumhard::util::geometry`, `baumhard::util::color`,
  `ColorFontRegions` (grapheme-cluster-range runs — see
  `lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md §B1`), and `RegionIndexer`
  (spatial index for hit-testing — distinct from `ColorFontRegions`).
  Do not redefine any of these in the app crate.

Missing primitives are added to Baumhard, not to `src/application/`. If
app code is about to grow a second implementation of something Baumhard
nearly does, extend Baumhard. Extending the foundation is the work, not
a detour from it.

## §2 All tasks are integration tasks

Mandala and Baumhard are carefully designed systems. A feature that
circumvents the design is not a feature, it is damage. It is not
possible to implement a new feature here without a thorough
understanding of the surrounding code, because you need to know how to
integrate.

- **Read before writing.** Contributions require reading the call sites,
  the adjacent modules, and the primitives you are reaching for. Pattern-
  matching from "how other codebases do it" is not integration.
- **Reach for the existing seam; do not add a parallel path.** If you
  grew a new hierarchy alongside an existing one, you missed a seam.
  Find it and use it.
- **Consider the downstream of every change.** A Baumhard primitive
  ripples into every consumer; a `MindMapDocument` change ripples into
  every interaction; a scene-builder change ripples into every frame.
- **No two components look alike, but they fit together.** Repetition
  of *shape* (near-duplicate code) is a smell; repetition of *idiom*
  (same naming, error posture, lock discipline) is the point. Honour
  the idioms; unify the shapes.

## §3 Architectural invariants

These shape what the codebase *is*. Changing one is a project-scale
decision, not a drive-by edit.

- **Single-threaded event loop.** `Application` owns `Renderer` directly.
  No channels, no worker threads, no `tokio`, no `std::thread::spawn` in
  interactive paths.
- **Model / view separation.** `MindMapDocument` owns the data model;
  `Renderer` owns GPU resources. The renderer reads intermediate
  representations (`Tree<GfxElement, GfxMutator>`, `RenderScene`). The
  renderer never reaches into the document; the document never holds
  GPU handles.
- **Render through the Baumhard tree.** All visuals — nodes,
  connections, borders, portals — converge on
  `Tree<GfxElement, GfxMutator>` and are shaped by
  `src/application/renderer/tree_walker.rs`. Some element types
  still travel through a flat scene intermediary
  (`scene_builder/`) before reaching the walker, but that's a
  consolidation seam, not a permanent second pipeline. New
  visuals belong in the Baumhard tree.
- **Mutation-first interaction.** Where a user action can be expressed
  as a `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>`, express it that way. Every user-facing
  mutation gets a matching `UndoAction` variant and an `undo()` branch.
- **Single-parent tree.** `MindNode.parent_id: Option<String>` is the
  hierarchy. Non-hierarchical relationships are edges with
  `edge_type: "cross_link"` or portal pairs.
- **Edges have no stable IDs.** Identified by `(from_id, to_id,
  edge_type)`. No `Uuid` fields, no maintained indices.
- **Everything is glyphs.** Text, borders, connections — all positioned
  font glyphs via cosmic-text. No rectangle shaders, no bitmap UI, no
  sprite atlases. A new shader pipeline is project-scale.
- **Platform-shared logic reachable without wgpu.** Touch math, gesture
  recognition, viewport math, anything that must behave identically on
  native and WASM lives in functions taking plain values.
- **Single dispatch funnel.** Every user-driven application-level
  behaviour is reified as an `Action` and dispatched via
  `dispatch_action` (`src/application/app/dispatch/native.rs`). New gestures,
  new console verbs that mutate state, new navigation keys: variant,
  default binding, dispatch arm — in that order. No second copy of
  Action body logic in a handler. Mouse handlers synthesize a gesture
  name through `gesture_key_name(MouseGesture::*)` and feed it through
  `action_for_gesture` (mouse — modifier-fallback) or
  `action_for_context` (keyboard — exact). See CONCEPTS.md §5 "Action
  dispatch".

  **Carve-outs that legitimately stay outside the funnel:**
  - **Modal steals.** When console / color-picker / label-edit /
    portal-text-edit / text-edit modals are open, their handlers
    consume the event before the funnel runs. Modals own the literal
    `winit::Key` payload (character insertion, IME sequences) which
    `Action` discards.
  - **Pre-funnel state-machine bookkeeping.** Selection updates on
    single-click, drag-state cleanup on release, double-click time +
    distance + hit detection, and the `last_click` tracker run
    before the funnel. They're not user-named effects; they're
    machinery the funnel rests on.
  - **Per-frame continuous-gesture state.** A drag's per-cursor-move
    delta (e.g. `RenderDecree::CameraPan(dx, dy)` in `event_cursor_moved`)
    legitimately stays inline. The funnel covers the discrete entry
    + exit (the press → `Action::PanCanvas`); the per-frame body
    is not a discrete-action concern.

  Anything else — a new gesture or a new console-verb behaviour that
  mutates document state or changes view state — must go through the
  funnel.

  **Macro-tier privilege gates are mandatory before non-User tiers
  ship.** Macros loaded from `~/.config/mandala/macros.json` share
  trust posture with `keybinds.json` — the user owns the file. The
  dispatcher gates two things on `MacroSource`:
  - `MacroStep::ConsoleLine` runs an arbitrary console verb, so it's
    User-tier-only via `MacroSource::allows_console_line`.
  - Destructive / I/O / clipboard `Action` variants
    (`SaveDocument`, `DeleteSelection`, `Cut`, `Paste`, `Copy`,
    `OrphanSelection`, `CreateOrphanNode`, `CreateOrphanNodeAndEdit`,
    `NewDocument`) are User-tier-only via
    `MacroSource::allows_action`.
  Privilege rejections **fail-closed** — the rest of the macro
  aborts so a `[DeleteSelection, ConsoleLine(rejected),
  SaveDocument]` pattern can't sneak its outer steps past the gate.
  Today only the User tier loads, so the gates are dormant; they
  MUST hold before app-bundle / map-inline / node-inline tiers
  ship.

  `DocumentAction` (carried by `MacroStep::CustomMutation`) is
  `#[non_exhaustive]`. Today every variant is a pure in-memory
  canvas-theme write, safe to expose. **Any new variant that
  performs file I/O, network access, arbitrary content load, or
  cross-process side effects MUST add a parallel gate at the
  `dispatch_macro` site** (look up the existing `allows_*` pattern
  on `MacroSource` and extend it).

  Source-tier assignment is loader-pinned. Each loader call site
  hardcodes the tier; nothing in the on-disk format can affect it.
  Future loaders MUST keep this invariant — only `include_str!` /
  `include_bytes!` content can be tagged `App`; user-modifiable
  paths (XDG data dirs etc.) tag as `User` or below.

## §4 Cross-platform as first class

Native desktop, browser on desktop, and browser on mobile are three
first-class deployments. The lowest-spec target sets the budget.

- **Mobile budget is binding.** Acceptable on a maxed-out desktop but
  stuttering on a mid-range phone in the browser is a bug. Unnecessary
  allocations, redundant walks, held lock guards burn battery as surely
  as they drop frames. See
  [`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md`](./lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md) §B1 and
  §B7 for specifics.
- **Touch-first input is a peer of mouse and keyboard**, not a fallback
  added later. Every interactive surface must work under tap, drag,
  pinch, long-press.
- **`cfg`-guard discipline.** Native-only: `#[cfg(not(target_arch =
  "wasm32"))]`. WASM-only: `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`. Everything
  else is shared and compiles for both. Use `cfg` guards, not traits,
  for platform abstraction.
- **New interactive features ship cross-platform from the start.** When
  a feature genuinely belongs native-only, the `cfg` guard sits at the
  module boundary and an entry appears in `CLAUDE.md`'s "Dual-target
  status" section naming the reason. "I'll add WASM later" is not a
  contract this repo recognises. `./test.sh`'s WASM type-check gate,
  `./build.sh --wasm`, and CI (`.github/workflows/test.yml`) enforce
  this.

## §5 Canonical or exemplary

Every merged change must *improve* the code — pay down debt, not add to
it. This is the single strongest rule in the document.

- **"Not caused by my changes" is not an excuse.** Who introduced a
  problem is irrelevant; only that it is fixed. If you notice a gap, you
  own the close.
- **Pre-existing deviations do not justify new ones.** The current state
  of the code does not rewrite the conventions.
- **Every (merge) commit is a state we would ship.** Tests green, formatted, no
  broken paths, no half-features behind flags, no commented-out blocks,
  no dead code.
- **No `// TODO`, no `// FIXME`, no `// HACK`.** If it needs doing, do
  it. If it does not, it does not belong.
- **No half-features.** Complete enough to be used, or not in the tree.
- **Fix fundamentals in the same commit that reveals them.** A refactor
  that leaves the suite red is not a refactor; it is an unfinished
  commit.
- **Avoid duplicating logic.** Identical logic copy / pasted throughout the codebase
  becomes a nightmare to maintain. If a function is needed in two or more places, the answer
  is never to copy it, but to use a single function called in two or more places.

## §6 Modular design by default

This project is about customization, flexibility, and extensibility; the
code should reflect that.

- **Divide and conquer.** Split files by conceptual boundary, not line
  count. Small files, each representing a clear concept, organized in
  modules. A module boundary is a promise: if the concept is
  load-bearing, name it and isolate it. A one-line helper is not a module; a
  private function used once does not need its own file. New files
  should feel justified — but so should monolith files that have
  outgrown their concept.
- **Reach for a strategy pattern when the shape is plural.** When there
  are clearly multiple reasonable ways to do something — and another
  context is likely to want a different one — use a strategy, trait, or
  equivalent extension point. Do not hardcode one approach into a shape
  that is inherently plural.

## §7 Strategic over-engineering

We may over-engineer wherever it makes sense, in the same way that a
church has more ceiling height than it strictly needs. We do not apply
industrial cost/benefit reasoning. This is not license for speculation.

- **Over-engineering serves the named trajectory**: plugins, a Baumhard
  script API, richer tree animations, complex file exports. It does not
  serve hypothetical consumers we cannot name.
- **Preserve seams.** A seam is where a future extension can attach
  without rewriting what is around it: a `pub` boundary on a Baumhard
  primitive, a composable mutator variant, a scene-builder hook taking
  user-supplied geometry. Removing one to "simplify" is permanent
  damage. When in doubt, preserve the seam.
- **Seam ≠ shape.** The surface can be replaced when it turns out wrong;
  the category of consumer stays reachable across the replacement.
- **Never dismiss a use case as niche.** "No one would do that" is not a
  design principle when the product is a creative-expression tool. A
  hard-to-support use case is a constraint on the design, not a reason
  to pretend it does not exist.
- **Three similar lines beats a premature abstraction.** Extract a
  helper when a pattern repeats three times *and* the repetition
  obscures intent. Two occurrences is a coincidence.

## §8 Documentation discipline

- **Every `pub` item in Baumhard carries a `///` doc comment** stating
  *purpose, inputs, costs* — note O(n) walks, allocations, clones, lock
  acquisitions. `cargo doc -p baumhard --no-deps` is a first-class
  deliverable. See
  [`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md §B9`](./lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md).
- **Public items in the mandala crate are documented when the purpose
  is non-obvious.** Cross-module entry points whose invariants matter
  carry a doc comment; a well-named private helper does not.
- **Module `//!` headers describe the concept, not the item list.**
  `cargo doc` generates the list; the concept is what the reader needs.
- **Inline `//` comments explain *why*, never *what*.** `// increment
  counter` on `counter += 1` is noise; `// clamp to canvas bounds so
  the palette cannot scroll off-screen during zoom` is signal.
- **Do not document the self-evident.** Excessive documentation of
  obvious code dilutes the comments that matter.
- **Do not touch documentation on code you did not change.** That churn
  is noise.

## §9 Error handling

- **No custom error types.** No `anyhow`, no `thiserror`, no custom
  `Error` enums. Adding one is a project-scale discussion.
- **Interactive paths must not panic.** Interactive paths are
  `Application::run` and everything reachable from it after the first
  frame: input, mutation, undo/redo, scene rebuild, render, document
  mutation. Degrade the frame, log via `log::warn!`/`log::error!`, keep
  running. A crash during editing is the one user-visible failure this
  codebase cannot tolerate. Defensive `let Some(...) else { return; }`
  in interactive paths is the sanctioned exception to §7's "trust
  internal invariants".
- **Startup paths use `expect("<reason>")` with a human-readable
  message.** Startup is everything before the first frame: CLI parse,
  `Renderer::new`, `fonts::init`, the initial `loader::load_from_file`,
  the `?map=` parser on WASM. Bare `unwrap()` outside tests is a bug.

## §10 No backwards-compatibility assumptions

We have no known users. We do not owe migration paths, deprecation
cycles, or backward-compatible shims.

- **Delete rather than deprecate.** Rename rather than alias. Change
  the surface rather than layer on it.
- **Data-model shifts update the fixtures and migration tooling in the
  same commit.** Do not carry dual shapes.
- **This licenses *cleanliness*, not carelessness.** Breaking changes
  still preserve the named trajectory's seams (§7).

## §11 Testing

See [`TEST_CONVENTIONS.md`](./TEST_CONVENTIONS.md) for the full spec.
Workspace-level commitment:

- **Extensive unit testing is a directive, not a nice-to-have.**
- **Fundamentals get the heaviest coverage** (mutations, undo, Unicode,
  geometry, loader edges, platform-shared logic).
- **New mutations and undo variants ship with tests in the same commit;
  new Baumhard primitives ship with a `do_*()` test and a criterion
  bench in the same commit.**
- **`./test.sh` green before every commit.**

## §12 Commit hygiene

- **Tests land in the commit that introduces the code they test.**
- **`./test.sh` is green before committing.** `./test.sh --lint` is
  advisory; review it. `./test.sh --bench` for performance-conscious
  Baumhard commits.
- **`./build.sh` is green for cross-platform changes.** Anything
  outside an explicit `cfg` guard must build for
  `wasm32-unknown-unknown` before commit.
- **Commit messages explain *why*, not what the diff shows.**
