//! Structural invariant verification for `.mindmap.json` files.
//!
//! Verification is a boundary check, not a best-effort parse: a file
//! either satisfies every named invariant the format guarantees or it
//! doesn't, and each violation is reported as a specific, named
//! property (tree shape, Dewey-ID consistency, edge references, palette
//! references, named-enum membership, text-run bounds) rather than a
//! free-form error message. That separation is what makes `verify` safe
//! to run as a gate: the loader can be permissive about missing or
//! defaulted fields, and everything load-tolerant-but-structurally-
//! invalid still surfaces here.
