//! Field-shape cleanup that runs after IDs, enums, and palettes have
//! been rewritten.
//!
//! miMind tracked sibling order with an explicit `index` integer; the
//! current format encodes that ordering in the Dewey-decimal ID itself
//! (`0.3` is the fourth child of `0`), so once IDs have been assigned
//! `index` is redundant and is removed. `channel` is a new field the
//! legacy format didn't carry — every node defaults to the base channel
//! (`0`) so the output validates against the post-migration invariants.
