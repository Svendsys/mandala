# IPC

Mandala's local inter-process control protocol: a line-delimited JSON
surface over a local socket that lets an external process — an LLM
agent, `mandalactl`, a test harness — drive, inspect, screenshot, and
record the running application with the same fidelity as a human at
the keyboard.

This document is the **wire-protocol source of truth**. The design
rationale (why each decision went the way it did, what was rejected)
lives in [`work_plans/LLM_IPC.md`](../work_plans/LLM_IPC.md); read
that first if you are changing this document rather than consuming
it. The Rust-side implementation lives under `src/application/ipc/`
(module layout in [Command registry](#command-registry-and-describe)).

## Transport

### Socket, flag, lifecycle

IPC is **opt-in per launch** via a CLI flag, following the existing
`--keybinds <path>` pattern in `src/main.rs`:

```sh
mandala maps/testament.mindmap.json --ipc /run/user/1000/mandala.sock
```

- `--ipc <path>` / `--ipc=<path>` — listen on a Unix domain socket
  (`SOCK_STREAM`) at `<path>`. No flag, no socket, no IPC threads —
  the interactive app pays zero cost when IPC is off. A flag with no
  path (`--ipc` last on the line, or `--ipc=`) is a startup error,
  not an IPC-less launch.
- The listener starts before the event loop takes over (alongside
  `FreezeWatchdog::spawn()` in `run_native.rs::run`) and lives for
  the process lifetime.
- **Startup, not runtime.** Bind failures are startup errors per
  CODE_CONVENTIONS §9: fail with `expect("<reason>")`, never limp
  along with IPC silently missing.
- **Stale-socket self-heal is type-gated — never a blind unlink.**
  When bind fails because the path already exists, the server
  unlinks and re-binds **only** after confirming, by `stat`, that
  the existing path is a Unix socket (`S_ISSOCK`) owned by the
  current user *and* that a probe `connect` to it is refused (no
  live listener). Any other existing path — a regular file, a FIFO,
  a directory, a socket owned by someone else, or a socket with a
  live listener — is left untouched and startup fails with a message
  naming the path. A typo'd `--ipc ~/thesis.txt` must fail loudly,
  never delete the file. The parent-directory permission check (next
  section) runs **before** this stat→unlink→bind sequence — an
  untrusted parent dir aborts startup outright, closing the
  unlink-then-someone-swaps-the-inode TOCTOU window.
- The socket file is unlinked on graceful exit. After an unclean
  exit the type-gated probe above makes the next launch self-heal.

### Ownership and permissions

The socket is as security-sensitive as `~/.config/mandala/macros.json`
(see [Trust model](#trust-model)). The server creates it with
owner-only permissions (`0600`, in a directory the user owns). It
is bound inside a fresh private (`0700`) staging directory, made
`0600` there, and only then hard-linked to its real name — so there
is no instant at which another user can reach it, and the link
refuses an existing path, so the final step can never replace
anything. A parent directory that does not exist yet is created,
owner-only (`0700`). The `0600` mode protects the socket's *bytes*,
but the socket's *name* is only as trustworthy as the directories
above it — whoever can rename or unlink an entry in any of them can
swap the path for one of their own while Mandala runs. So the server
refuses to bind unless **every directory on the path** is owned by
the user or by root, and is writable by nobody but its owner (group- **or**
world-writable fails) unless it has the sticky bit — one
mechanically checkable predicate per directory. The owner clause is
not redundant with the sticky bit: a sticky directory's *owner* can
still unlink or rename what is in it. "Every directory on the path"
is judged the way the kernel resolves the path the client will
connect through — component by component from `/`, following each
symbolic link where it stands — so it covers each directory that
*holds* a symlink on the path as well as every directory the link's
target leads through, chains included (a symlink in a directory
another user can write is a name they can re-point). Checking only
the canonical path would miss exactly the link holders. A path
longer than the platform's socket-path limit (107 bytes on Linux,
103 elsewhere) is refused up front, naming it. A root-owned sticky directory
(e.g. `/tmp`) is accepted but second-best; the recommended location is
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (already `0700` on every mainstream distro).
Never a TCP port: filesystem permissions are the access-control
mechanism.

### Single controller

Exactly **one client** is served at a time.

- The first connection becomes the controller.
- While a controller is connected, additional connections receive a
  single frame `{"event":"connection_rejected","data":{"reason":"busy"}}`
  and are closed **immediately** — a dedicated acceptor keeps calling
  `accept()` regardless of controller state, so a second agent learns
  it's busy at once rather than blocking in the OS backlog until the
  controller disconnects (mechanism: `work_plans/LLM_IPC.md` §D2).
  The reject write is non-blocking (best-effort; on `EWOULDBLOCK` the
  rejectee is simply closed) so a rejectee that never reads can't
  stall the acceptor and starve the real controller's reconnect. No
  queueing, no arbitration — two agents dragging the same node
  concurrently is not a coherent workflow, and an arbitration layer
  would be complexity with no named consumer (CODE_CONVENTIONS §7).
- When the controller disconnects (EOF, error, teardown), the
  listener accepts the next connection. **No session state survives
  a disconnect**: event subscriptions reset, pending `clock.wait`s
  are canceled, undelivered frames are discarded. (An in-flight
  recording is app state, not session state — see
  `capture.record_start`.) A reconnecting client starts from the
  `hello` greeting like any fresh client. This is enforced by a
  **controller generation** (a counter incremented on each accept):
  every request, reply, event, and pending wait is stamped with the
  generation it belongs to, the boundary drops any frame whose
  generation isn't current, and the reader's disconnect wakes the
  main thread to cancel that generation's pending waits and reset its
  subscriptions — so a departed controller's late `timeout` reply can
  never land on its successor (design: `work_plans/LLM_IPC.md` §D2).
  The departure is noticed by the controller's reader a moment after
  the socket closes; a client that connects inside that moment is
  refused `busy` like any other, and retries.
- **A half-close ends the requests, not the replies.** A client that
  closes its write half after sending (`printf … | nc -N -U`) still
  receives a reply to every request it sent before the close: the
  disconnect is ordered behind them. The server closes the
  connection once those replies are written.

Attach-after-launch and re-attach are first-class: the intended
workflow is a human launching (or already running) the app and an
agent attaching later while the human watches.

### Windows

The Windows transport is a **named pipe** at
`\\.\pipe\mandala-<name>` (the `--ipc` value names the pipe), with
the pipe's security descriptor restricted to the current user —
the closest Windows analog to a `0600` socket in `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`.
Localhost TCP was rejected: it is reachable by every local user on
a multi-user machine (weaker than file permissions), it collides
with other services on port allocation, and it triggers firewall
consent dialogs. The **envelope and command semantics** are
transport-agnostic and carry over unchanged; the *framing* (NDJSON
line-delimiting) and the byte caps below are byte-stream constructs,
re-expressed per transport — a named pipe keeps them, and the parked
WebSocket transport (IPC-15) replaces `\n`-delimited lines with
WebSocket message boundaries and re-expresses the size caps as
max-message limits. "Same protocol" means the same envelope and
commands, not the same framing bytes.

IPC-02 ships the Unix transport; the named-pipe adapter is a
self-contained follow-up inside the same transport module. IPC-02
(#62) landed without a Windows environment to build it in, so the
adapter is tracked as #169. Until it lands,
`--ipc` on a Windows build fails at startup with a message pointing
at this section (honest fail-fast per §9/§10 — no silent no-op of a
user-requested feature).

### WASM

There is no WASM transport; the `src/application/ipc/` module is
`#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`-gated at the module boundary,
mirroring `console_input`. The carve-out entry lives in `CLAUDE.md`
"Dual-target status"; the browser trajectory (WebSocket transport +
browser-side capture, same envelope and commands) is parked in
IPC-15. Browsers cannot open local sockets, so this is a transport
gap by nature, not a design gap.

### Framing

- **NDJSON**: one JSON object per line, `\n`-terminated, UTF-8. A
  frame must not contain a raw newline (JSON string escapes cover
  every payload). No pretty-printing on the wire. A trailing `\r`
  is tolerated (it is JSON whitespace), and a final line the client
  closes the connection without terminating is still read as a line.
- Empty (or whitespace-only) lines are ignored — but still counted
  by `data.line` below, which indexes every line the client sent.
- **Inbound line cap: 1 MiB.** A longer line is consumed and
  discarded up to its terminating newline and answered with a
  `parse_error` reply (`"id": null`). The stream stays usable.
- **Outbound frame cap: 8 MiB.** A reply that would serialize larger
  is replaced by a `reply_too_large` error naming the file-sidecar
  alternative for that command (see
  [Large payloads](#large-payloads)).
- Malformed JSON, non-object frames, or missing/invalid envelope
  keys are answered with `parse_error` / `invalid_params` and never
  terminate the process — hostile input degrades, it does not crash
  (same posture as the loader's cycle rejection, CODE_CONVENTIONS §9).
- A `parse_error` reply carries `data.line` — a monotonic
  0-based index of the inbound line that failed. Because a
  `parse_error` has `id: null` (there was no parseable id to echo)
  **and** is written ahead of any in-flight command replies (the
  reader emits it directly, without a main-thread round-trip), it is
  the one reply a pipelining client can neither correlate by `id`
  nor locate by stream position; `data.line` is how the client
  identifies which sent line was rejected.

Why NDJSON and not JSON-RPC 2.0 or length-prefixed binary: the
consumers are LLM agents and shell tools — one `socat` away from a
debuggable session, one `jq` away from parsed output. JSON-RPC's
extra ceremony (envelope-in-envelope, batch semantics, notification
rules) buys nothing the envelope below doesn't already provide, and
binary framing optimizes exactly the payloads this protocol routes
to files instead (see [Large payloads](#large-payloads)).

## Envelope

Three frame shapes exist on the wire: **requests** (client → server),
**replies** (server → client, correlated by `id`), and **events**
(server → client, unsolicited).

### Request

```jsonc
{"id": 7, "cmd": "clock.step", "ms": 100}
```

| key | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | string or integer | Required. Client-chosen, echoed verbatim on the reply, ≤ 256 bytes serialized (a longer id is answered `invalid_params` with `"id": null` — the oversized value is not echoed). The server treats it as opaque and does not deduplicate — reusing an in-flight id is the client's own confusion. |
| `cmd` | string | Required. A registered command name: `family.verb`, lowercase snake_case on both sides of the dot. Exactly two bootstrap commands are unnamespaced: `describe` and `ping`. |
| *params* | — | Command parameters sit **flat at the top level** beside `id` and `cmd`. `id` and `cmd` are reserved words no command may use as a parameter name (see the rule below). Unknown parameters are rejected with `invalid_params` (strictness catches agent typos early; a tolerant server would silently ignore `regoin=`). |

Flat parameters (rather than a nested `"params"` object) are a
deliberate ergonomic choice for the primary consumer — an LLM
composing frames by hand: one less nesting level to get right, and
the common commands read as a sentence.

**Reserved-word rule (load-bearing for the flat layout).** Because
params share the top level with the envelope, no command may name a
parameter `id` or `cmd`. Commands that genuinely need to *reference*
a request id or a command name give the parameter a distinct name —
`describe` filters on `command` (not `cmd`), `act.macro` targets a
`macro_id` (not `id`), `input.touch` carries a `pointer_id` (not
`id`). This is what keeps flat params unambiguous; the registry's
compile-time parameter descriptors (see
[Command registry](#command-registry-and-describe)) enforce it — a
command declaring an `id` or `cmd` param fails to compile, so the
collision can't reach the wire. (A nested `params` object would
dodge the rule but cost every frame the nesting level flat params
exist to save; the rule is the cheaper trade.)

### Reply

```jsonc
{"id": 7, "ok": true, "result": {"now_ms": 4100.0, "frames_run": 6}}
```

```jsonc
{"id": 8, "ok": false,
 "error": {"code": "unknown_cmd", "message": "no command 'clock.stepp' — closest is 'clock.step'"},
 "warnings": [{"code": "deprecated_alias", "message": "…"}]}
```

| key | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | — | Echo of the request `id`; `null` when the request was unparseable. |
| `ok` | boolean | Required. `true` ⇒ `result` present; `false` ⇒ `error` present. |
| `result` | object | Command-specific payload. Present iff `ok:true`; `{}` when a command has nothing to say. |
| `error` | object | `{"code", "message", "data"?}`. Present iff `ok:false`. See [Errors](#errors). |
| `warnings` | array | Optional; omitted when empty. See [Warnings](#warnings--per-command-diagnostics). |
| `revision` | integer | Reserved. Once IPC-14 lands, every reply carries the render revision observed after the command executed (the pixels-affecting counter — see [`events`](#events--event-stream--revision-ipc-14)), so agents can order replies against change events without an extra round-trip. Absent until then. |

Replies are **not guaranteed to arrive in request order**. Most
commands reply immediately and in order, but deferred-reply commands
(`clock.wait`, and any future long-running command) reply when their
condition resolves while later requests keep executing. Correlate by
`id`, always. The corollary: a pending deferred reply is **not a
barrier** — a request sent while a `clock.wait` is pending executes
immediately, against whatever state it finds. A command that must
observe the settled state (the canonical mutate → `clock.wait` →
`capture.screenshot` sequence) is sent **after** the wait's reply
arrives; that round-trip is the synchronization point. Pipelining
the screenshot behind a still-pending wait reintroduces exactly the
race the wait exists to prevent.

### Event

```jsonc
{"event": "document_changed", "data": {"revision": 42}}
```

| key | type | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `event` | string | Event class name, snake_case. |
| `data` | object | Class-specific payload; always present, `{}` allowed. |

Events are opt-in via `events.subscribe` (IPC-14). Three classes
are transport-level and never subscription-gated: `hello` and
`shutdown` always go to the controller; `connection_rejected` goes
to a refused connection instead of any reply. Reserved classes are
listed under
[`events` — event stream + revision](#events--event-stream--revision-ipc-14).

### Handshake and versioning

On accept, before reading anything, the server greets:

```jsonc
{"event": "hello", "data": {
  "protocol": 1,
  "app": "mandala",
  "version": "0.1.0",        // Cargo package version
  "pid": 31337,
  "map": "maps/testament.mindmap.json"   // null before first load
}}
```

All `hello` fields except `map` are process-static
(`protocol`/`app`/`version`/`pid`); `map` is live app state
(`MindMapDocument.file_path` — the file the document is bound to, so
it follows a load, a `new` and a save-as, and is `null` while no file
is bound). The state-free boundary threads do
not read it directly — the main thread publishes the current path
into a shared snapshot (an `Arc` swapped whenever the bound path
changes), which
the acceptor reads when composing the greeting, preserving the "I/O
threads never touch app state" invariant (§D2).

- `protocol` is a single integer, currently **1**. Pre-V1 there is
  no compatibility machinery beyond it (CODE_CONVENTIONS §10: break
  freely, delete rather than deprecate): **any** breaking change to
  framing, envelope, or a shipped command bumps the integer, in the
  same commit that changes this document. Additive changes (new
  commands, new optional params, new result keys, new warning
  codes) do not bump it — clients must tolerate unknown keys in
  replies and events. **Widening an existing enum-valued field
  (a new `outcome`, `mode`, `state`, or event-class value a client
  branches on) is breaking, not additive** — it bumps the integer,
  because a client's exhaustive branch would silently misclassify
  the new value. Clients should still treat an unrecognized enum
  value as the safe default for that field (e.g. an unknown
  `act.action` `outcome` → treat as `"unhandled"`).
- Clients pin against this document, check `protocol` in `hello`,
  and refuse to drive a server they don't understand (`mandalactl`
  refuses unless `--force`). There are no version-negotiation
  frames; there is exactly one live protocol per binary.
- `describe` (below) is the runtime mirror of this document for
  every *merged* command, kept honest by unit tests asserting the
  registry matches the documented surface; the IPC-16 sweep
  re-verifies before the epic closes. (This document's family map
  also lists not-yet-merged commands as forward contract; `describe`
  reflects only what the running binary actually registers.)

On graceful shutdown (window close — the only quit path today), the
server best-effort sends `{"event":"shutdown","data":{}}` before
closing the socket, so agents can distinguish "app exited" from
"connection died".

### Errors

Errors are **structured JSON values, never Rust error types** — the
protocol's error posture is CODE_CONVENTIONS §9 verbatim: no
`anyhow`/`thiserror`/custom enums in the implementation; interactive
paths never panic on IPC input; a malformed or hostile frame
degrades to an error reply and the app keeps running. There is no
IPC-visible distinction between "bad request" and "command ran and
failed" beyond the code itself.

- `code` — stable snake_case identifier. **Codes are API**: agents
  and `mandalactl` may branch on them; renaming one is a breaking
  change (protocol bump).
- `message` — human/LLM-readable explanation. Messages are *not*
  API: wording may change freely, and good messages say what to do
  next ("no document loaded — send `act.console` with `open <path>`").
- `data` — optional object with structured context (e.g.
  `{"elapsed_ms": 10000}` on `timeout`).

Initial code registry (families add codes in their own sections;
additions are non-breaking):

| code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `parse_error` | Frame was not a JSON object / exceeded the 1 MiB line cap. `id` is `null`; `data.line` locates the failed inbound line. |
| `unknown_cmd` | `cmd` names nothing in the registry. |
| `invalid_params` | Missing/mistyped/unknown parameter. `data.param` names the offender. |
| `unsupported` | Command exists but not on this platform/build (e.g. future Windows gaps). |
| `busy` | A single-instance command was already pending when another was issued — today, a second `clock.wait` while one is in flight (waits are exclusive per controller). Distinct from the connection-level `connection_rejected` event. |
| `overloaded` | Request queue full (1024 pending); resend after draining replies. |
| `reply_too_large` | Serialized reply exceeded 8 MiB; `data.bytes` is its size, and `data.hint` names the file-sidecar parameter when the command has one. |
| `no_document` | Command needs a loaded document and none is. |
| `not_found` | A referenced entity (node id, macro id, mutation id) does not exist. |
| `console_error` | The console rejected the `act.console` line (unknown verb) or the verb reported an error; `message` is the console's own text. |
| `timeout` | Deferred command hit its deadline (`clock.wait`). |
| `internal` | The degrade-don't-crash catch-all: the command hit a state it could not honor; details in `message`. |

### Warnings — per-command diagnostics

Release builds keep `warn!` and `error!` (`release_max_level_warn`;
#45 chose that), but they reach the app's stderr, and an agent
attached over the socket does not read that stream. **Replies are the
diagnostic channel the agent does see.** Every `warn!` / `error!` a
command's execution emits is *also* carried in the reply's `warnings`
array, in the log line's own words. This is the one warning-carrying
convention for the whole surface:

```jsonc
{"id": 3, "ok": true,
 "result": {"ran": true},
 "warnings": [
   {"code": "macro_gate_rejected",
    "message": "macros: macro 'tidy' (source Map): ConsoleLine step rejected — only User-tier macros may run console verbs; aborting remaining steps"}
 ]}
```

- `warnings` is an array of `{"code", "message"}` (same stability
  rules as error codes), omitted when empty. A failed command carries
  its warnings too: the diagnostics that explain a failure are the
  ones an agent most needs.
- **How a warning gets there: the execution window.** The registry
  runs every command handler inside a capture window
  (`baumhard::util::log::capture`). The logger the app installs
  offers each record to the window open on the main thread, so
  every `warn!` / `error!` emitted while the command executes lands
  in its reply. That covers the dispatch arms, document setters,
  console verbs and Baumhard primitives it reaches. *Log and push,
  same site, same text* therefore holds by construction: the log
  line is the warning, emitted once, and a `warn!` added anywhere
  later is reported with no further work. `RUST_LOG` decides what is
  printed to stderr, not what a reply carries. A narrow filter does
  not hide a degrade from the agent.
- **Codes.** A log site that wants a machine-branchable identity
  attaches it as the record's `code` key-value
  (`log::warn!(code = GATE_REJECTED_CODE; "macros: …")`), and the
  warning carries that code. Every other record is classified by its
  level. A degrade that happens below a seam *without* logging is
  not seen by the window. Making it log, or giving its site a code,
  is sanctioned §2 integration work, and implementing issues own the
  completeness of their own commands' warnings.
- One reply carries at most 64 captured records (the first ones,
  since the first warning is usually the cause), each message at most
  4096 bytes (a longer one is cut on a grapheme boundary and says how
  much was elided). Any records beyond that are counted in a closing
  `warnings_truncated` entry. The bound is on bytes, not just records,
  because a message can echo arbitrary input, such as a failed console
  line. Without it, an oversized reply would be replaced whole by
  `reply_too_large`, and the command's result would be lost with it.
- Degrades *outside* any command's execution window (a font drop
  during an ordinary interactive frame) are not retroactively
  attached to replies. Streaming those would be a `log_line` event
  class. #45 settled on `release_max_level_warn`, so such a class is
  now possible; whether to ship it is IPC-14's call, and it is
  deliberately not designed here.

Warning code registry (additions are non-breaking, like error codes):

| warning code | meaning |
|---|---|
| `log_warn` | A `warn!` the command's execution emitted with no code of its own. `message` is the log line. |
| `log_error` | An `error!` the command's execution emitted with no code of its own. `message` is the log line. |
| `warnings_truncated` | The command emitted more diagnostics than one reply carries (64); `message` says how many were left out. |
| `macro_gate_rejected` | A macro step was refused by its tier's privilege gate, and the rest of the macro aborted (`format/macros.md` "Privilege model"). |
| `save_unbound` | `SaveDocument` found no file path bound to the document, so nothing was written. `SaveDocumentAs` (or `act.console` with `save <path>`) binds one. |
| `save_failed` | `SaveDocument` could not write the bound file; `message` carries the I/O error. |
| `console_error` | A console line run by something other than `act.console` failed: a file-path `Action`'s line, or a macro `ConsoleLine` step. Matches the `act.console` error code, so a console failure is branchable however the line was reached. `message` is the console's own text. |

### Large payloads

Two disciplines keep frames within the caps:

1. **Pixels never travel inline.** `capture.*` commands write PNG /
   frame-sequence artifacts to disk and reply with absolute paths
   (plus geometry sidecars). No base64 screenshots in JSON — an
   agent reading a 4 MB base64 blob through its context window is
   the failure mode this epic exists to avoid.
2. **Structured dumps offer a file sidecar.** Any command whose
   reply can plausibly exceed the 8 MiB cap (`scene.dump` on a
   pathological map) takes an optional `to_file: "<path>"` param;
   with it, the reply inlines only `{"path", "bytes"}`. Without it,
   an oversized reply degrades to `reply_too_large` with
   `data.hint: "to_file"`.

### Coordinate spaces

Two named spaces appear throughout the surface; commands taking or
returning geometry say which one they use, and commands accepting
either take a `"space"` parameter:

- **`surface`** — physical pixels on the rendered surface, origin
  top-left, y-down. The space of screenshots, sidecar rects, and
  synthetic mouse coordinates (default for `input.*`).
- **`canvas`** — the document's world space (the space of
  `MindNode` offsets), as used by the camera. Default for
  `capture.screenshot region=`.

Conversions go through the same camera math the renderer uses
(`Camera2D`); `query.camera` exposes the current transform so
clients can convert without a round-trip per point.

## Trust model

**IPC executes at the `User` tier. It is not a new tier.**

The reasoning, in full, is `work_plans/LLM_IPC.md` §D4; the operative
rules:

- Attaching requires the `--ipc` flag at launch: the user owns the
  flag exactly as they own `keybinds.json` and `macros.json`
  (`format/macros.md` "Privilege model"). A process that can reach
  the socket is running as the same OS user and could already edit
  those files; the socket's `0600` permissions (or the pipe's
  per-user descriptor) are the enforcement of that equivalence.
- Direct IPC dispatch — `act.action`, `act.console`, `input.*` —
  carries User-tier privileges: destructive Actions, console verbs,
  file I/O verbs all pass, same as a human at the keyboard. That is
  the epic's charter ("as well as a human"), and any weaker tier
  would contradict it.
- **Macros keep their own tier.** `act.macro` fires
  `dispatch_macro`, and the macro's loader-pinned `SourceTier`
  gates it exactly as if a keybind had fired it: a Map- or
  Inline-tier macro still cannot run `ConsoleLine` or destructive
  Actions just because IPC pulled the trigger. IPC is a User-tier
  *initiator*, never a privilege *escalator* — the fail-closed gate
  in `dispatch_macro` (`src/application/app/dispatch/macro_core.rs`)
  is untouched by this protocol. An anonymous step list sent as
  `act.macro`'s `steps` runs through that same gated loop
  (`run_macro_steps`) at the `User` tier. Privilege attaches to
  where instructions were authored, and the IPC client authored
  those steps, exactly as it authors an `act.console` line.
- Provenance is a logging concern, not a privilege concern: IPC
  dispatch sites attribute their origin in diagnostics (and, once
  IPC-14 lands, in events), which covers auditability without a
  `SourceTier::Ipc` variant that would either duplicate `User` or
  cripple the feature.
- The threat model of opening a hostile `.mindmap.json` is
  **unchanged** by IPC (tiers and gates as in `format/macros.md`).
  IPC adds no remote surface: no TCP, no discovery, no
  auto-connect. The new asset to protect is the socket path itself,
  handled under [Ownership and permissions](#ownership-and-permissions).

`format/macros.md`'s SOURCE-OF-TRUTH tier list records this mapping;
anyone adding or reordering a macro tier must re-evaluate it there
and here in the same commit.

## Threading contract (wire-visible consequences)

The full architecture is CODE_CONVENTIONS §3 (amended by IPC-01) and
`work_plans/LLM_IPC.md` §D2. What a client can observe:

- Commands execute **on the main thread, between winit events**, with
  the same access an input handler has. IPC never races user input;
  a command observes a consistent document and its effects are
  ordered with respect to the user's own actions.
- The socket is serviced by dedicated boundary threads that never
  touch app state, so the app never blocks on a slow client. An
  **acceptor** always waits on `accept()` — that is what lets a
  second client get its `connection_rejected` *immediately* rather
  than sitting in the OS backlog until the controller leaves (see
  [Single controller](#single-controller)); a per-controller
  **reader** parses inbound lines; a per-controller **outbound**
  writer serializes replies and events (per-controller so its queue
  is discarded by construction when the controller leaves — nothing
  crosses to the successor).
- **Backpressure is asymmetric by frame kind.** *Replies* are
  contractual, and are never dropped while the connection lives:
  when **256** replies wait in the outbound queue, the server
  **pauses executing that controller's requests** until the writer
  has made room, then resumes where it stopped. A pipelining client
  that reads its replies therefore never loses one, however far
  ahead it sends (up to the request-queue cap below). A client that
  has stopped reading is detected at the socket instead: once a
  write makes **no progress for 10 seconds** — the kernel's socket
  buffer full of output the client has not read — the client is
  declared dead and the connection dropped (reconnect and
  resubscribe). The reader's own replies (`parse_error`,
  `overloaded`, …) wait for room too, which stops it reading:
  pressure lands on the client that is not draining, never on the
  app. *Unsolicited events* the client never paced itself against
  (`camera_changed`, `animation_*`, …) are instead
  **coalesced/dropped-oldest by revision** under pressure rather
  than pausing anything — an agent that pauses to think for a few
  seconds while an animation emits a flood of events must not have
  its session stalled or torn down. So a slow-reading client loses
  *stale events*, not its session; only a client that stops reading
  *replies* altogether is dropped. (IPC-14 owns the coalescing rule;
  the event carries a `revision`, so "keep the newest per class" is
  well-defined.)
- More than **1024 queued unexecuted requests** answers further
  requests with `overloaded` until the queue drains.
- A wedged main loop (the `FreezeWatchdog` scenario) also wedges
  IPC replies — by design, the watchdog then produces its
  diagnostic abort and the client sees EOF. IPC deliberately has no
  side-channel into app state that could observe or mutate a hung
  loop.

## Command registry and `describe`

Commands live in **one module per family** under
`src/application/ipc/commands/<family>.rs`. Each module exports one
`Family` value, and `commands/mod.rs`'s `FAMILIES` table lists them,
one line per family. That table mirrors the console's `COMMANDS`
slice (`src/application/console/commands/mod.rs`). The registry in
`src/application/ipc/registry.rs` dispatches against it and renders
`describe` from it. Family PRs (IPC-04 through IPC-14) therefore land
in parallel without conflicts (CODE_CONVENTIONS §6): each adds its
own module plus one registrar line.

**Reaching the funnels across a module boundary.** The seams a
command invokes are `dispatch_action`, `dispatch_macro`,
`execute_console_line`, and `InitState` / `input_context()`. They are
`pub(in crate::application::app)`, but `crate::application::ipc` is a
*sibling* of `app`, so a command handler cannot see them directly.
Command handlers therefore run against an **app-side execution
context**: the `CommandTarget` trait (`ipc/target.rs`). Its native
implementation, `IpcCommandTarget` (`app/ipc_target.rs`), wraps the
same `InputHandlerContext` a winit input handler receives. Each
method is one funnel and nothing else. This is the indirection
`dispatch_macro` already uses through `MacroDispatchTarget`
(`app/dispatch/macro_core.rs`). It keeps the funnels private and the
`ipc` modules free of `app` internals. A handler reaches the app
through `drive()` (`&mut`) or `observe()` (`&`), so a read-only
command cannot mutate it. Whether a command changed pixels is
answered by the target from each funnel's own outcome
(`CommandTarget::changed_view`): a handled Action, a ran macro step,
a console line that rebuilt the scene, had a side effect or closed
the console. The event loop requests a redraw only then, as a winit
handler does after a mutating input. A refused action, a failed or
read-only console line, or a macro whose steps all skipped costs no
frame.

Before the window exists, which on native is also before the
document does, there is no app to reach, and a command that needs
one answers `no_document`.

Registration is **self-describing by construction**: a command's
registry entry carries its name, summary, parameter descriptors
(name / type / required / doc) and result descriptors, and the
constructor requires them. A command without documentation does not
compile. Parameter descriptors are built by a `const fn` that rejects
a parameter named `id` or `cmd` (the [reserved-word rule](#request)).
Every descriptor lives in a `const`, so an envelope collision is a
compile error, never a wire ambiguity.

The registry validates a request against its descriptors before the
handler runs. An unknown parameter, a missing required one, or one
of the wrong JSON type is `invalid_params` naming it in `data.param`.
`null` counts as mistyped, not omitted. Cross-parameter rules
("exactly one of") and value rules (an enum word, a range) are the
handler's to check. Every handler validates its whole request before
it touches the app, so a refused request has no side effects.
`describe` renders the table:

### `describe`

Params: `command` (string, optional). It describes just this one
command instead of the whole table, and is named `command`, not
`cmd`, per the reserved-word rule. A `command` that names no
registered command is `invalid_params` with `data.param: "command"`.

Result: `protocol` (the integer `hello` carries), `app` (always
`"mandala"`), `version` (the Cargo package version), `commands` (one
entry per registered command, in name order: `name`, `family`,
`summary`, `params`, `result`), and `events` (the event catalog, one
`name` and `doc` per class).

The two unnamespaced bootstrap commands report `"family":
"bootstrap"`. Until IPC-14 lands, the `events` array lists the three
transport-level classes, the only ones this build can send.

```jsonc
{"id": 1, "cmd": "describe", "command": "clock.step"}
```

```jsonc
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {
  "protocol": 1,
  "app": "mandala",
  "version": "0.1.0",
  "commands": [
    {"name": "clock.step",
     "family": "clock",
     "summary": "Advance the virtual clock and run frames until caught up.",
     "params": [
       {"name": "ms", "type": "integer", "required": false,
        "doc": "Virtual milliseconds to advance. Exactly one of ms / frames."},
       {"name": "frames", "type": "integer", "required": false,
        "doc": "Exact heartbeat count to run. Exactly one of ms / frames."}
     ],
     "result": [
       {"name": "now_ms", "type": "number", "doc": "Virtual clock after the step."},
       {"name": "frames_run", "type": "integer", "doc": "Heartbeats executed."}
     ]}
  ],
  "events": [
    {"name": "document_changed", "doc": "Fires after any committed document mutation; data carries the revision."}
    // … the full reserved-event catalog; abbreviated here
  ]
}}
```

The `events` array is always the complete registered event catalog
(IPC-14 finalizes it) — it is not narrowed by the `command` filter,
which scopes only the `commands` array. Above it is abbreviated to
one entry for space.

The type vocabulary is deliberately small: `string`, `integer`,
`number`, `boolean`, `object`, `array`. Enum-valued strings document
their values in `doc`. A parameter whose wire form is an existing
serde representation with more than one shape reports its words
joined with `|`. `act.action`'s `action` is `string|object`: a string
for a unit `Action` variant, an object for a payload variant. This is
agent-discovery metadata, not a JSON
Schema dialect — `format/ipc.md` remains the authoritative reference,
and the two are kept byte-honest by tests as described under
[Handshake and versioning](#handshake-and-versioning).

### `ping`

Params: none. Result: `now_ms` (number), the app's `now_ms()` clock.
That is virtual time when `clock.set_mode virtual` is active. `ping`
is the liveness probe, and also the cheapest way to read the clock.

## Command families

The family map, each family's owning issue, and its module. Every
command is listed here from birth; field-level reference sections
below are filled to the depth this design pins — capture and clock
shapes are pinned in full (their stability is what `mandalactl` and
the repo skills build against), query/scene/input/events field lists
are owned by their issues and appended to this document in the same
PR that implements them.

| family | module (`src/application/ipc/commands/`) | owner | commands |
|---|---|---|---|
| *(bootstrap)* | `meta.rs` | IPC-02; registry by IPC-03 | `describe`, `ping` |
| `act` | `act.rs` | IPC-03 | `act.action`, `act.console`, `act.macro` |
| `query` | `query.rs` | IPC-04 | `query.document`, `query.selection`, `query.camera`, `query.mode`, `query.status`, `query.animations`, `query.editors`, `query.undo` |
| `scene` | `scene.rs` | IPC-05 | `scene.dump`, `scene.hit_test`, `scene.find_text` |
| `input` | `input.rs` | IPC-06 | `input.mouse_move`, `input.mouse_button`, `input.wheel`, `input.key`, `input.text`, `input.touch` |
| `capture` | `capture.rs` | IPC-07 (+ IPC-08) | `capture.screenshot`, `capture.record_start`, `capture.record_stop` |
| `clock` | `clock.rs` | IPC-09 | `clock.status`, `clock.set_mode`, `clock.step`, `clock.wait` |
| `events` | `events.rs` | IPC-14 | `events.subscribe`, `events.unsubscribe`, `events.revision` |

## `act` — dispatch bridge (IPC-03)

The §2 rule made wire-visible: these commands **reach the existing
funnels**, never a parallel control path. Each one drives the app
through a single funnel, the same one a key binding, the console
prompt or a bound macro reaches. So everything they do is undoable,
gated, and behaviorally identical to the same operation performed by
hand. **Undo fidelity follows from that, and nothing else adds to
it.** `act.action` with `"DeleteSelection"` pushes the undo entry the
Delete key pushes, and a following `"Undo"` (or Ctrl+Z) restores
exactly what it would after a keyboard delete.

All three need the app. Before its window, and with it its document,
exists, they answer `no_document`. Each validates its whole request
first, so a refused request (`invalid_params`) has no side effects.
The event loop requests a redraw after one only when it reports a
change of view (see [Command registry](#command-registry-and-describe)).
A failed console line run by an Action or a macro step is reported as
a `console_error` warning.

### `act.action`

Dispatch one `Action` through `dispatch_action`, exactly as a key
binding fires it.

| param | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `action` | string\|object | yes | The `Action`, in the externally tagged form macro `Action` steps deserialize through: a string for a unit variant (`"Undo"`), and a `{"Variant": payload}` object for a payload variant (`{"OpenDocument": "/path/m.mindmap.json"}`). An unknown variant or a mistyped payload is `invalid_params`, naming what serde expected. |
| `x`, `y` | number | no, together | A pointer position. With it, the cursor stands there for this dispatch only (afterwards it is back where the user's real pointer is, so their next wheel or key acts where they point, not where the agent did), and the dispatch carries what the canonical click hit test (`compute_click_hit`, the one mouse presses use) finds under it, as a mouse handler's `DispatchHit` does. Pointer-driven arms then behave as under a real pointer: `DoubleClickActivate` routes on the hit, and `ZoomIn` / `ZoomOut` / `CreateOrphanNode` use the position. Without it they use the current cursor, and `DoubleClickActivate` reports `unhandled`. One without the other is `invalid_params`. |
| `space` | string | no | The coordinate space of `x`/`y`: `"canvas"` (default) or `"surface"` ([Coordinate spaces](#coordinate-spaces)). Only valid with `x`/`y`. |

Result: `outcome` (string), `"handled"` or `"unhandled"`: the
funnel's `DispatchOutcome`. `unhandled` means the action did not
apply in the current context. A `Console*` action with the console
closed is one: every `Console*` body edits the open modal, so with
none open it reports that nothing ran. So is a file Action whose
line failed (`OpenDocument` of a missing file, `SaveDocumentAs` to an
unwritable path) and a `SaveDocument` that wrote nothing. Each of
those also carries a warning saying why: `console_error` for the
file-path Actions, `save_unbound` or `save_failed` for `SaveDocument`.
Treat an unrecognized value as `"unhandled"`.

```jsonc
{"id": 1, "cmd": "act.action", "action": "ZoomIn"}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"outcome": "handled"}}
{"id": 2, "cmd": "act.action", "action": "DoubleClickActivate", "x": 412, "y": 96, "space": "surface"}
```

`act.action` dispatches at the `User` tier (see
[Trust model](#trust-model)), so destructive, clipboard and file
Actions pass, as they do for a human at the keyboard. It applies the
Action and nothing around it. The keyboard handler's modal steals,
its context resolution and its macro / custom-mutation fall-through
are the *key's* machinery, not the Action's. Driving those is
`input.key`'s job (IPC-06).

### `act.console`

Run one console line through the console's own parse → execute →
side-effect drain, **without** opening the console.

| param | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `line` | string | yes | The line, as typed at the prompt (`"section show"`, `"open maps/a.mindmap.json"`). |

Result: `output` (array of strings), the verb's output lines, one
element per line. It is empty for a blank line and for a verb that
succeeds silently. A line whose head names no verb, and a verb that
reports a failure, is `ok:false` with code `console_error` and the
console's own message (`"unknown command: frobnicate"`).

**Result path.** `execute_console_line` returns what the verb
produced (`LineOutcome`: blank, unknown, or the verb's
`ExecResult`) instead of writing it into the scrollback. Each caller
renders it. **The scrollback is the prompt's own transcript**: only
the console prompt prints an outcome there. Every other caller
`warn!`s a failure: a key-bound file Action, a macro `ConsoleLine`
step, `SaveDocument`, and every IPC command. Under IPC that warning is
also the reply's warning, and `act.console` returns the outcome
itself. So nothing an agent sends writes lines into a console the
user has open, or leaves its overlay stale. No fake open modal is
built to scrape. **The full
side-effect drain still runs**: `ConsoleSideEffect::ReplaceDocument`
(the document swap for `open` / `new`), `rebuild_all`, and any modal
handoff, because "behaviorally identical to a human typing it" (§2)
requires those effects, not just the return value. What IPC skips is
the human's half: an open console's scrollback and the command
history are left alone, by `act.console` and by the `act.action` /
`act.macro` paths that run console lines or save.

### `act.macro`

Run a macro through the macro dispatcher's gated step loop, the one
body that runs macro steps.

| param | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `macro_id` | string | one of | Run the registered macro with this id (named `macro_id`, not `id`, per the [reserved-word rule](#request)). It runs under the tier its loader pinned (see [Trust model](#trust-model)). An id registered in no tier is `not_found`. |
| `steps` | array | one of | Run these steps, an anonymous macro in the on-disk step form of `format/macros.md`: `{"kind": "Action", "action": …}`, `{"kind": "CustomMutation", "id": …, "target"?: …}`, `{"kind": "ConsoleLine", "line": …}`. They run at the `User` tier: the IPC client authored them, and IPC executes as `User`. A list that does not parse is `invalid_params` naming `steps`. |

Exactly one of `macro_id` / `steps`: neither, or both, is
`invalid_params`.

Result: `ran` (boolean), the dispatcher's any-step-executed flag. A
step that did not apply does not count: an unhandled Action, a
skipped custom mutation, or a `ConsoleLine` that failed (also
reported as a `console_error` warning). A privilege-gate abort is not
an error. The steps before it ran, so
the reply is `ok:true` and carries a `macro_gate_rejected` warning
naming the refused step.

```jsonc
{"id": 3, "cmd": "act.macro", "steps": [
  {"kind": "Action", "action": "ZoomFit"},
  {"kind": "ConsoleLine", "line": "fps on"}]}
{"id": 3, "ok": true, "result": {"ran": true}}
```

## `query` — application state (IPC-04)

Read-only views of what the application knows: what a person reads off
the screen chrome, and the app's mental state. Eight commands:
`query.document`, `query.selection`, `query.camera`, `query.mode`,
`query.status`, `query.animations`, `query.editors`, `query.undo`.

**Zero mutation, by construction.** A query reaches the app through
`observe()` (`&`), and the only reads the execution context offers are
`&MindMapDocument` and a `&self` projection of the shell state. So a
query cannot flip `dirty`, push an undo entry, rebuild a scene or ask
for a frame (the reply's repaint flag is never set, and a query polled
in a loop costs no frame). A test holds each of those to it.

**No mirror structs.** Each wire form is a projection that sits beside
the state it exposes (`document/ipc_state.rs`, `app/ipc_state.rs`).
Where a type is pure serde (`MindMap`, `AnimationTiming`) the
projection is its own serializer; elsewhere it is an exhaustive `match`
with no wildcard arm. A new `SelectionState`, `InteractionMode`,
`DragState`, `ThrottledDrag` or `UndoAction` variant therefore fails
the build until its wire form is decided and written here. Every
variant-shaped value is an object whose `kind` is **the variant's own
name**, with that variant's ids beside it. Where a projection leaves
state out, this section names the omission.

**Errors.** Before the app exists every query answers `no_document`.
After it, the four queries that read the document (`query.document`,
`query.selection`, `query.animations`, `query.undo`) answer
`no_document` when its initial load failed. `query.camera`,
`query.mode`, `query.status` and `query.editors` need no document and
answer regardless. A query's own parameter failures are
`invalid_params`, naming the parameter.

### `query.document`

The open document: `file_path`, `dirty`, `undo_depth`, `map`, `counts`
and, on request, the whole model as `mindmap`.

| param | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `fields` | array | no | Which parts to return, as strings from the list below. Default: every part but `mindmap`, the one whose size is unbounded. Empty, mistyped or unknown words are `invalid_params`. Replies carry the parts in the order below, whatever order they were asked for. |
| `pointer` | string | no | An RFC 6901 JSON Pointer into the serialized model (`"/nodes/1.2"`, `"/edges/0"`, `"/canvas/background_color"`). The reply's `mindmap` is then the value found there. Implies `fields: ["mindmap"]` when `fields` is omitted, and is `invalid_params` when `fields` lacks `mindmap`. A pointer that resolves to nothing is `not_found`, and is reported before anything is written to `to_file`. Only the selected subtree is serialized: the first one or two tokens (`/nodes/<id>`, `/edges/<index>`, `/palettes/<name>`, …) are resolved against the model's own structures, so polling `/nodes/0/position` costs one node, not the map. The result is exactly what a pointer into the whole serialized model would give. A field the serialized form omits while empty (`palettes`, `custom_mutations`, `macros`) is absent to a pointer too. |
| `to_file` | string | no | An absolute path. The file sidecar of [Large payloads](#large-payloads): the fields are written there as JSON and the reply is only `path` and `bytes`. Use it when `mindmap` may exceed the 8 MiB reply cap. The model is **streamed** from the app's own structures into the file, so no copy of it is built beside it. The write is **atomic**: the bytes go to a temp file in the same directory (created exclusively and with `O_NOFOLLOW`), are flushed and `fsync`ed, and are then renamed into place. A failure partway (a full disk) removes the temp file and leaves the destination exactly as it was, so an earlier good export is never replaced by truncated JSON. A replaced file takes the default permissions of a new file. |
| `overwrite` | boolean | no | Only with `to_file`. Allow replacing an existing file; default `false`, where an existing file is `invalid_params`. Without it the file is published with `link(2)`, which fails if the name exists, so a file created in the meantime is not clobbered. A symlink or a directory at the path is `invalid_params` either way, and a symlink is never written through: the temp file is created with `O_NOFOLLOW` and published by `rename(2)`, which replaces the directory entry itself. A missing parent directory is `invalid_params`. |

| result field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `file_path` | string | The path the document is bound to; `null` for a document never saved. |
| `dirty` | boolean | Unsaved changes. |
| `undo_depth` | integer | Entries on the undo stack (`query.undo` lists them). |
| `map` | object | `{"name", "version"}` of the loaded map. |
| `counts` | object | `{"nodes", "edges", "sections", "palettes", "custom_mutations", "macros"}`. `sections` is summed over every node. |
| `mindmap` | object | The model through its own serde, the `.mindmap.json` shape (`schema.md`). A save adds the loader's preserved unknown keys; a query does not, because they are the loader's bookkeeping and not part of the model. With `pointer`, the value found there. |
| `path`, `bytes` | string, integer | With `to_file` only, and then the *only* fields: the absolute path written and its size. |

The `mindmap` field round-trips: parsed back as a `MindMap` and
serialized again it is the value the app serialized, so what an agent
reads is what the app holds.

```jsonc
{"id": 1, "cmd": "query.document"}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {
  "file_path": "maps/testament.mindmap.json", "dirty": false, "undo_depth": 0,
  "map": {"name": "testament", "version": "1.0"},
  "counts": {"nodes": 252, "edges": 258, "sections": 254, "palettes": 12, "custom_mutations": 0, "macros": 0}}}
{"id": 2, "cmd": "query.document", "pointer": "/nodes/0/position"}
{"id": 2, "ok": true, "result": {"mindmap": {"x": -179.432388, "y": -2413.803223}}}
{"id": 3, "cmd": "query.document", "fields": ["mindmap"], "to_file": "/tmp/model.json"}
```

### `query.selection`

Params: none. Result: the `SelectionState`, an object whose `kind` is
`None`, `Single`, `Multi`, `Section`, `MultiSection`, `SectionRange`,
`Edge`, `EdgeLabel`, `PortalLabel` or `PortalText`, with the variant's
ids beside it. Lossless: every field of every variant is carried.

| `kind` | keys beside it |
|---|---|
| `None` | — |
| `Single` | `node_id` |
| `Multi` | `node_ids` (array) |
| `Section` | `node_id`, `section_idx` |
| `MultiSection` | `sections`: array of `{"node_id", "section_idx"}` |
| `SectionRange` | `node_id`, `section_idx`, `section_span` `{"lo", "hi"}` (inclusive **section indices**), `grapheme_range` `{"start", "end"}` (half-open **grapheme-cluster** offsets into that section's text; the two ranges are different units, see `SelectionState`) |
| `Edge`, `EdgeLabel` | `edge`: `{"from_id", "to_id", "edge_type"}` |
| `PortalLabel`, `PortalText` | `edge` (as above), `endpoint_node_id` |

```jsonc
{"id": 1, "cmd": "query.selection"}
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"kind": "Single", "node_id": "1.2"}}
```

### `query.camera`

Params: none. The `surface` ↔ `canvas` transform ([Coordinate
spaces](#coordinate-spaces)). A canvas point `p` lands at surface
`(p - center) * zoom + surface / 2`, so a client converts without a
round trip per point.

| result field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `center` | object | `{"x", "y"}`: the canvas point at the middle of the viewport. |
| `zoom` | number | Zoom factor; above 1 is zoomed in. |
| `zoom_min`, `zoom_max` | number | The clamp the camera enforces (`0.05` and `5.0`). |
| `surface` | object | `{"width", "height"}` in physical pixels. |

```jsonc
{"id": 1, "ok": true, "result": {"center": {"x": 12.0, "y": -340.5}, "zoom": 0.75,
  "zoom_min": 0.05, "zoom_max": 5.0, "surface": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080}}}
```

### `query.mode`

Params: none.

| result field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `interaction_mode` | object | `kind`: `Default`, `Reparent` (`sources`), `Connect` (`source`), `NodeEdit` (`node_id`) or `Resize` (`target`: `{"kind": "Node", "node_id"}` or `{"kind": "Section", "node_id", "section_idx"}`). |
| `drag_state` | object | `kind`: `None`, `Pending`, `PendingRight`, `Panning`, `SelectingRect` or `Throttled`. `Pending` carries `start_pos` (surface pixels), `hit_node`, `hit_section_idx` and `grabs`, the names of any handle the press landed on (`edge_handle`, `portal_label`, `edge_label`, `section_resize_handle`, `node_resize_handle`). `PendingRight` carries `start_pos`, `start_canvas`, `hit_node`, `hit_section_idx`. `SelectingRect` carries `start_canvas` and `current_canvas`. `Throttled` names its `gesture` (`MovingNode`, `MovingSection`, `SectionResize`, `NodeResize`, `EdgeHandle`, `PortalLabel`, `EdgeLabel`) with what it is acting on (`node_ids`, `node_id`, `section_idx`, `side`, `edge`, `handle`, `endpoint_node_id`). A gesture's pre-drag snapshots, pending delta and throttle are omitted: bookkeeping, not identity. |
| `modals` | array | Every open modal, in the order the keyboard handler consults them: `console`, `color_picker`, `single_line_edit`, `text_edit`. Keys do not have one owner. The console takes **every** key. The color picker claims **only its own** keys (its commit, cancel and nudge verbs, and its clipboard keys); every other key falls through to the editors. The single-line editor, then the node text editor, take every key that reaches them. `query.editors` has each one's state. |
| `key_owner` | string | Who receives an *ordinary* key right now: `console`, `single_line_edit`, `text_edit`, or `none` (normal dispatch). Never `color_picker`: with a picker and a text editor both open, a key the picker does not claim goes to `text_edit`, and that is what this field says. Type against `key_owner`, not against the head of `modals`. |
| `hovered_node` | string | The node id under the pointer; `null` over none. |
| `cursor_pos` | object | `{"x", "y"}`: the last known pointer position, in surface pixels. |

### `query.status`

Params: none. Result: `text` (string), the cyan mode-status line the
renderer shows (`"editing: 1.2 — section [1 of 3]"`), or `null` when none
is showing (Default mode). The app already writes this line for a human,
so an agent reads it instead of re-deriving it.

### `query.animations`

Params: none. Result: `active` (boolean, whether any animation instance is
running), `paused` (boolean, whether a tree-mutating drag has suspended
the tick), `count` (integer) and `animations` (array, oldest-started
first). Each entry:

| key | meaning |
|---|---|
| `target_id`, `section_idx` | The node animated, and the section when the trigger resolved to one (`null` otherwise). |
| `mutation_id` | The `CustomMutation` id being animated. |
| `start_ms`, `elapsed_ms` | The app-clock start and the time since. The app clock is the app's wall clock, milliseconds since process start (the one `ping` reports and the per-frame drain ticks against). It is **not** virtual today: the `clock` family that would make it so (IPC-09) has not landed, so `elapsed_ms` is not deterministic until it does. |
| `phase` | `delay` before the delay elapses, `running` while it interpolates, `due` once the full envelope has elapsed and the next tick commits it, and `paused` while a tree-mutating drag (a node or section move or resize) has suspended the tick. While paused, `elapsed_ms` and `progress` are frozen at the value the animation resumes from (on release the drain shifts each `start_ms` forward by the pause), and nothing commits until the drag ends. Poll `paused` to tell a stalled animation from a finished one. |
| `progress` | The linear position through the duration, `0` to `1`, before easing. |
| `timing` | The mutation's `AnimationTiming` through its own serializer (`duration_ms`, `delay_ms` when set, `easing`). |

The from/to node snapshots and the mutation list are omitted. They are
the document's own business, and large. `active: false` with an empty
list is how an agent sees that animations have settled; `active: true`
with `paused: true` is a drag holding them.

### `query.editors`

Params: none. Each modal editor's live state, `null` when it is closed,
and the document's active previews.

| result field | type | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `console` | object | `input`, `cursor` (grapheme index), `history_len`, `history_idx`, `scrollback_len`, `scrollback` (the last 50 lines, each `{"kind": "Input"\|"Output"\|"Error", "text"}`), `completion_count`, `completion_idx`, `scroll_offset`. Omitted: each line's pinned font family, the completion rows, the wheel accumulator. |
| `color_picker` | object | `mode` (`{"kind": "Standalone"}`, or `{"kind": "Contextual", "handle", "seed_var_ref", "seed_hsv"}` where `handle` is `Edge` (`edge_index`), `Node` (`node_id`, `axis`) or `Section` (`node_id`, `section_idx`, `axis`, `grapheme_range`)), `hue_deg` (`[0, 360)`), `sat` and `val` (`[0, 1]`), `size_scale`, `gesture` (`Move`, `Resize` or `null`), `hover_preview`. Omitted: the cached layout, glyph-measurement caches and wheel placement, which are geometry (`scene.dump` is where what it looks like lives). |
| `single_line_edit` | object | The edge-label / portal-caption editor: `target` (`{"kind": "EdgeLabel", "edge"}` or `{"kind": "PortalText", "edge", "endpoint_node_id"}`), `buffer`, `cursor_grapheme_pos`, `original` (the target's string when the editor opened; `null` if none). |
| `text_edit` | object | The node text editor: `node_id`, `section_idx`, `buffer`, `cursor_grapheme_pos`, `selection_anchor` (`null` without a sub-range selection), `exit_to_default_on_close`. Omitted: the buffer's styling regions and the pre-edit snapshot cancel restores from. |
| `previews` | object | What the scene shows in place of committed model state, never serialized, never undoable, never dirtying: `label_edit` (`edge`, `buffer`), `portal_text_edit` (`edge`, `endpoint_node_id`, `buffer`), `color_picker` (`edge`, `color`), `border` (`kind`: `Nodes`, `Sections`, `CanvasDefault`, `CanvasSectionFrame`, `CanvasSectionFrameFocused`, with its targets; the staged values are omitted) and `rect_select` (the node ids a Shift+drag currently covers). Each is `null` when none is live. An agent whose pixels disagree with `query.document` looks here first. |

Cursors are **grapheme-cluster** indices into their buffer, never bytes:
the unit the editors use, and the one a user counts as characters.

### `query.undo`

| param | type | required | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `limit` | integer | no | How many entries to return, newest first. Default 20, at most 1000 (a larger or negative value is `invalid_params`, so the cap is learned rather than silently applied). |

Result: `depth` (integer, the whole stack) and `entries` (array, newest
first, the order `Undo` takes them). Each entry is `{"kind", "node_ids"?,
"index"?}`: `kind` is the `UndoAction` variant's name (`MoveNodes`,
`CustomMutation`, `ReparentNodes`, `DeleteEdge`, `CreateEdge`,
`EditEdge`, `CreateNode`, `EditNodeText`, `EditNodeStyle`,
`EditNodeZoom`, `CanvasSnapshot`, `EditNodeAabb`, `DeleteNode`), with the
nodes it touches or, for the edge entries, the edge `index`. The
before-images an entry carries are what undo restores from and are not
reported.

## `scene` — laid-out scene introspection (IPC-05)

What is *actually on screen*: `scene.dump` (visible elements with
resolved geometry and displayed text, honoring `ZoomVisibility` and
fold state; takes `to_file` per [Large payloads](#large-payloads)),
`scene.hit_test` (`x`, `y`, `space` → the same answer the click
pipeline would produce, via the canonical hit-test path, never a
fork of it), `scene.find_text` (locate nodes/sections/labels by
displayed text). Field-level reference lands with IPC-05, appended
here.

## `input` — synthetic raw input (IPC-06)

Below-the-funnel input with human fidelity, for the gestures that
are not discrete Actions: drags, hovers, modal typing, IME-ish text.
`input.mouse_move` (`x`, `y`, `space?`), `input.mouse_button`
(`button`, `state`: `press`/`release`/`click`, optional position),
`input.wheel` (`dy`, optional position), `input.key` (logical key +
modifiers, press/release), `input.text` (string, delivered to the
open modal editor as typed characters), `input.touch` (`phase`,
`pointer_id`, `x`, `y` — the recognizer's vocabulary; the finger
identifier is `pointer_id`, not `id`, per the
[reserved-word rule](#request)). The fidelity contract:
these enter **the same handler entry points** winit events enter, so
selection state machines, drag thresholds, double-click timing, and
modal steals behave byte-for-byte as with real input. Field-level
reference lands with IPC-06, appended here.

**Pacing model (pinned here because `settled` and virtual time
depend on it).** A gesture whose fidelity depends on events landing
in *different* frames — a drag (press, then moves past threshold,
then release), a double-click (two clicks within the time window) —
cannot fire its sub-events in a single `user_event` drain or they
collapse to one instant and the timing logic misreads them. So
`input.*` events that carry a frame-spanning gesture enqueue into a
bounded **injected-input queue** (cap **1024**; overflow →
`overloaded`) that the heartbeat drains **one sample per frame**,
stamped with the current `now_ms()`. Under `clock.set_mode virtual`,
`clock.step` advances this queue one sample per virtual heartbeat,
so injected drags/double-clicks are deterministic too. A single
discrete injection (one `mouse_move`, one `key` press) applies
immediately. `clock.wait until=settled` requires this queue empty
(condition (b) below), so "wait until my synthesized drag finished"
is expressible. The queue, the one-per-frame cadence, and the
virtual-clock coupling are IPC-06's to implement, but their shape is
pinned here so IPC-09's `settled` and IPC-06's fidelity contract
agree on one model rather than each inventing its own.

## `capture` — screenshots and recordings (IPC-07, IPC-08)

Shapes pinned here in full; `mandalactl` and the `mandala-drive` /
`mandala-record` skills build against them.

**Artifact lifecycle.** The per-item caps (64 Mpx per image, 3600
frames per recording) bound each artifact but not their number. The
**server-chosen** artifacts dir is bounded: it is created under
`$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR` (or a temp dir), scoped to the process, capped at
a total byte budget with oldest-evicted (ring-buffer), and removed
on graceful exit — a long session cannot silently fill the disk.
Artifacts written to a **client-supplied** `path` / `dir` are the
client's to manage; the server neither caps nor reclaims them (the
client asked for that location explicitly).

### `capture.screenshot` (IPC-07)

Offscreen render of the current document state — never a window
grab, so it works identically under a compositor, Xvfb, or (post
IPC-10) no display at all.

| param | type | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `path` | string | server-chosen file in a per-session artifacts dir | Absolute path for the PNG. Parent dir must exist. Write guards (same-user trust tier, but an LLM composing a path clobbers by accident far more readily than a human): the server does **not** follow a symlink at `path` (`O_NOFOLLOW`), and refuses to overwrite an existing file **outside** the per-session artifacts dir unless `overwrite: true` is set — an unset `overwrite` hitting an existing external file is `invalid_params`. |
| `overwrite` | boolean | `false` | Allow overwriting an existing file outside the artifacts dir. Inside the artifacts dir, overwrite is always allowed. |
| `width`, `height` | integer | current surface size | Offscreen target size in physical pixels; camera center/zoom preserved, aspect follows the target. Each side is clamped to `1..=16384`, and `width × height × scale²` must not exceed **67,108,864** device pixels (64 Mpx, ~8K square); a request over either bound is `invalid_params`, never a best-effort giant allocation (degrade-don't-crash — an offscreen texture is a real GPU allocation). |
| `region` | object | — | `{"x","y","w","h"}` in the `space` coordinate space: frame this rect instead of the current camera view. `width`/`height` still set the target resolution; the aspect rule below governs mismatches. |
| `space` | string | `"canvas"` | Coordinate space of `region`: `"canvas"` (default) or `"surface"` (converted through the camera as of capture time). For `"surface"`, the pixel grid is the **live window surface** (the camera's current surface size), *not* the requested `width`/`height` offscreen target — the region is resolved against the window the human sees, then the camera it derives is rendered into the offscreen target. Ignored without `region`. |
| `scale` | number | `1.0` | Supersampling factor, clamped to `0.1..=4.0`. |
| `format` | string | `"png"` | `"png"` is the only value at pin time; the param exists so adding one is non-breaking. |
| `sidecar` | boolean | `true` | Write the geometry sidecar next to the PNG (`<path>.geometry.json`). |

Result: `{"path", "sidecar_path"?, "width", "height"}` (plus
`revision` at the envelope level once IPC-14 lands).

**Aspect rule.** When `region`'s aspect ratio differs from the
target's, the capture is **extended, never distorted or
letterboxed**: the camera frames the smallest aspect-matching rect
that contains `region`, center-preserved. Everything inside
`region` is guaranteed visible, extra canvas may appear along one
axis, and the pixel↔canvas mapping stays a single uniform zoom —
so the sidecar's rect math remains trivially affine.

**Geometry sidecar** — the pixels↔ids map that lets an agent point
at what it sees:

```jsonc
{
  "protocol": 1,
  "revision": 42,                          // once IPC-14 lands
  "surface": {"width": 1920, "height": 1080, "scale": 1.0},
  "camera": {"center_x": 12.0, "center_y": -340.5, "zoom": 0.75},
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "1.2.3",
     "rect": {"x": 401.0, "y": 92.5, "w": 218.0, "h": 64.0},  // surface px, pre-clip
     "clipped": false,                     // true when partially outside the target
     "sections": [{"index": 0, "rect": {"x": 401.0, "y": 92.5, "w": 218.0, "h": 30.0}}]}
  ]
}
```

Elements suppressed by `ZoomVisibility` or folding at capture zoom
are absent — the sidecar describes the rendered image, not the
document (that is `scene.dump`'s job).

### `capture.record_start` / `capture.record_stop` (IPC-08)

Frame-sequence recording; assembly into GIF/video is deliberately
**outside the app** (the `mandala-record` skill, IPC-13, drives
`ffmpeg`/`gifski` over the manifest). One recording at a time;
starting while recording is `invalid_params`, stopping while idle is
`invalid_params`.

`capture.record_start` params: `dir` (string, default server-chosen),
`fps` (integer, default `30`, clamped `1..=60`), `max_frames`
(integer, default `600`, hard cap `3600` — the recorder stops itself
and warns rather than filling a disk), plus `width`/`height`/
`region`/`space`/`scale` exactly as `capture.screenshot`. Result:
`{"dir"}`.

An in-flight recording is **app state, not session state**: it
keeps capturing across a client disconnect, and a reconnecting
controller stops it with `capture.record_stop`.

An active recording is a **continuation/timer source**: on an
otherwise static scene the loop would park in `ControlFlow::Wait`
and no heartbeat would fire, so nothing would be captured until an
unrelated event woke it. While a recording runs, the loop instead
parks in `WaitUntil(next frame deadline)` (`now + 1000/fps` ms) —
the same idle-timer shape the FPS grace already uses — so frames
land at the requested cadence with the canvas idle. Under
`clock.set_mode virtual` the recording is instead driven by
`clock.step`, and the **frame-emission rule** is pinned so the
manifest is deterministic: a frame is captured each time virtual
`now_ms()` crosses a `1000/fps` boundary, **not** once per internal
heartbeat. So `clock.step ms=1000` at `fps=30` emits exactly 30
frames regardless of how many heartbeats the step ran, and each
frame's `t_ms` is its `1000/fps` boundary. (Real mode uses the same
boundary rule against the wall clock; a frame that would land late
because a heartbeat overran is dropped and counted in
`dropped_frames`.)

`capture.record_stop` params: none. Result: `{"dir", "frames",
"manifest_path", "dropped_frames"}`.

Frames are `frame_%05d.png` plus `manifest.json`:

```jsonc
{"protocol": 1, "fps": 30, "width": 1280, "height": 720,
 "frames": [{"index": 0, "t_ms": 0.0, "file": "frame_00000.png", "revision": 42}],
 "dropped_frames": 0}
```

`t_ms` is capture-clock time (virtual when the virtual clock is
active — recording under `clock.step` yields perfectly paced
sequences; that interplay is IPC-08/09's implementation seam, and
`manifest.json` is its contract).

## `clock` — determinism (IPC-09)

Time virtualization over the one clock bridge (`now_ms()`), plus the
settling primitive every capture workflow needs.

- **`clock.status`** — result: `{"mode": "real" | "virtual",
  "now_ms": <number>}`.
- **`clock.set_mode`** — params: `mode` (`"real"` / `"virtual"`).
  In virtual mode the app-observed clock advances **only** via
  `clock.step`; animation and timing behavior becomes a pure
  function of the step sequence. Virtual time reshapes **every**
  `now_ms()` consumer, not just animations — throttled-interaction
  pacing, the drag anim-pause, double-click detection, and FPS
  timing all read the same bridge — so under virtual mode the whole
  interactive clock is stepped, which is what makes captures
  deterministic (IPC-09 owns how the bridge is virtualized). Result:
  `{"mode", "now_ms"}`.
- **`clock.step`** — params: exactly one of `ms` (integer) or
  `frames` (integer) — neither, or both, is `invalid_params`.
  Virtual time advances at a pinned cadence of **one heartbeat per
  16 ms** (≈60 fps — the rate the app targets), so `ms` and `frames`
  are two spellings of the same work: `frames = ceil(ms / 16)`, and
  each is clamped to the *same* budget, **`frames ≤ 100_000`**
  (⇒ `ms ≤ 1_600_000`, ~27 virtual minutes); a value over the bound
  is `invalid_params` and the client chunks. The heartbeats run
  synchronously — deterministic catch-up is the point — and the loop
  **ticks the `FreezeWatchdog` (`unparked`) once per heartbeat inside
  the step**, so the run is watchdog-safe *by construction* (a
  genuinely stuck single heartbeat still trips the 10 s threshold;
  the bound is a responsiveness/DoS limit, not the safety mechanism).
  Result: `{"now_ms", "frames_run"}`.
- **`clock.wait`** — params: `until` (`"settled"` /
  `"animations_complete"`), `timeout_ms` (integer, default
  `10_000`, clamped `1..=60_000`; always **wall-clock**
  milliseconds — the deadline is a client-liveness guard, so a
  frozen virtual clock must not disable it). **Exclusive per
  controller**: only one `clock.wait` may be pending at a time; a
  second while one is in flight is rejected `busy` (there is no named
  use for concurrent waits, and unbounded pending waits would be a
  memory/scan-cost vector). Its `id` stays in flight until the wait
  resolves or is canceled — a client must not reuse that `id` before
  then. **Deferred reply**: the condition is evaluated at the end of
  every heartbeat and at the deadline; other commands keep executing
  while a wait is pending; a disconnect cancels it; a pending wait is
  **not a barrier** (see [Reply](#reply)). While a wait is pending
  and the loop would otherwise park in `ControlFlow::Wait`, it parks
  in `WaitUntil(nearest deadline)` instead — the FPS idle-grace
  precedent already in `run_native.rs` — so a deadline fires even
  when no heartbeat would otherwise run, without polling. On
  success: `{"elapsed_ms"}`. On deadline: `ok:false`, code
  `timeout`, `data.elapsed_ms`.

Wait conditions, defined against the per-frame `drain_frame`
heartbeat (CONCEPTS §5 "Event loop and `drain_frame`"):

- **`animations_complete`** — `MindMapDocument` reports no active
  animations.
- **`settled`** — at an evaluation point, all of: (a)
  `needs_continuation()` is false (no throttled drag pending, no
  picker-hover pending, no active animations, no dirty connection
  geometry); (b) no IPC-injected input remains queued; (c) **no
  redraw is pending** — every pixels-affecting command has requested
  its redraw and none is outstanding; and (d) the renderer has
  **rendered** the frame reflecting the most recent pixels-affecting
  command — i.e. the render pass ran and the GPU buffers are current
  for that revision. In plain terms: **the rendered scene is the
  final consequence of every command the agent has sent so far**, and
  capturing now is race-free *with respect to the agent's own
  commands*. (It is not fenced against a concurrent human — see the
  scope note below.)

  **Rendered, not on-screen-presented.** Condition (d) is
  deliberately about the *render* completing, not a swapchain
  *present*. `capture.screenshot` is offscreen and must work under an
  occluded/minimized window and (post IPC-10) with no display at all
  — where the compositor never presents. Gating `settled` on an
  on-screen present would make every capture workflow time out in
  exactly the containerized/Xvfb environment the epic targets. So
  `settled` observes that the render for the current revision has
  executed (buffers current), which the offscreen capture path can
  satisfy without a surface. This also settles the IPC-10 headless
  interaction here rather than deferring it downstream.

  **The arbiter is a render revision, not the document revision.**
  The naive "rendered at the current *document* revision" is
  insufficient: view-only commands — a wheel zoom, an `act.action`
  pan, a selection-highlight change — repaint without mutating the
  document, so a stale pre-command frame would already match the
  document revision and `settled` would resolve before the repaint
  renders. The counter that gates `settled` therefore advances on
  **every pixels-affecting command** (document mutation *or*
  view/selection change), and each such command **requests a redraw**
  (see [`work_plans/LLM_IPC.md`](../work_plans/LLM_IPC.md) §D2 — the
  IPC drain mirrors the existing winit handlers' `request_redraw`
  exactly). `settled` holds only once the rendered frame carries that
  render revision. IPC-14 introduces the counter as a
  render-affecting revision for this reason; if wave order runs
  IPC-09 first, IPC-09 carries the field forward itself.

  **Scope: `settled` fences the agent, not the human.** The
  "race-free" guarantee is only against the agent's own prior
  commands. In the "human watches while agent drives" workflow a
  human can move the mouse, type, or pan the canvas between the
  `clock.wait` reply and the following `capture.screenshot`, and that
  input is *not* fenced (nor could it be). Worse, a human's
  continuous camera-pan drag is an inline per-frame gesture
  (CODE_CONVENTIONS §3 carve-out) that changes pixels **without**
  going through a command or bumping the render revision, so
  `needs_continuation()` can read false mid-drag-pause and `settled`
  can resolve while the human is mid-gesture. For byte-reproducible
  captures the agent should drive an instance with no concurrent
  human (the container/Xvfb case); the guarantee is exact there.

  `MindMapDocument.dirty` deliberately plays no role here: despite
  the name it is the *unsaved-changes* flag — set by every document
  setter, cleared only at construction and on a successful `save`,
  read by the `open` / `new` verbs' guards — not a rebuild-pending
  signal. (A design-time correction: issue #61's sketch assumed
  otherwise, as did CONCEPTS' "Dirty flag" entry, fixed alongside
  this document. A settled condition gated on it would never resolve
  after any unsaved mutation.)

  One residual non-determinism to know about: with the FPS overlay
  on (a native `fps` diagnostic, off by default), its idle-grace flip
  repaints the overlay region *after* `settled` resolves without
  bumping the render revision, so two "settled" screenshots can
  differ in that corner. A diagnostic must not become observable
  behavior (the reason it isn't a continuation source), so `settled`
  ignores it — capture with the overlay off for byte-identical
  frames.

There is deliberately **no** third `"idle"` condition: once settled,
the loop parks by construction (`ControlFlow::Wait`), and the only
residual timer is the FPS overlay's idle-grace flip — a diagnostic
that observes behavior and must not become observable behavior.

## `events` — event stream + revision (IPC-14)

Push notifications, opt-in per class: `events.subscribe`
(`classes`: array of class names), `events.unsubscribe` (`classes`
optional — omit for all), `events.revision` (result:
`{"revision"}` — the monotonic revision counter IPC-14 introduces;
also surfaces as the reply-envelope `revision` key). The counter
advances on every **pixels-affecting** change — document mutations
and view/selection changes alike — so it doubles as the `settled`
arbiter (see `clock.wait`); a change that repaints without touching
the document still bumps it.

Reserved event classes at pin time: `hello`, `shutdown`,
`connection_rejected` (the three transport-level classes, never
subscription-gated; `connection_rejected` is delivered to the
refused connection, not the controller), `document_changed`,
`selection_changed`,
`camera_changed`, `mode_changed`, `animation_started`,
`animation_completed`. IPC-14 owns the class list and payloads and
appends them here. A `log_line` class streaming degrades from
outside any command's window is possible now that #45 kept `warn!`
and `error!` in release builds. Whether to ship one is IPC-14's call
(see [Warnings](#warnings--per-command-diagnostics)). Tree-level
(Baumhard `EventSubscriber`) events are out of scope until the #43
reshape lands; app-funnel events above do not depend on it.

## Change discipline

- This document is the SSOT. A PR that changes wire behavior
  changes this file in the same commit, and bumps `protocol` if the
  change is breaking (see
  [Handshake and versioning](#handshake-and-versioning)).
- `describe` must stay byte-honest against this document; the
  registry's self-description tests enforce it, and IPC-16's
  convergence sweep audits it before the epic closes.
- Command families extend their own section here in the PR that
  implements them; the family map table above is the index and
  gains no rows without a design-level decision recorded in
  `work_plans/LLM_IPC.md`.
