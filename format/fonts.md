# Fonts

Mandala bundles every font it ships with. There is no system-font
fallback on either native or WASM — what's compiled in is what's
available, on every target. This keeps native and browser visuals
identical and lets the binary render any saved map without external
assets.

## Where fonts are pinned in the data model

Two fields hold the user's font choice:

- **`MindNode.text_runs[*].font`** (`String`) — per-run pin on a
  node's text. See [`text-runs.md`](./text-runs.md).
- **`MindEdge.glyph_connection.font`**
  (`Option<String>`) — pin for the edge body's connection glyphs.
  When `null` (or absent), the edge inherits the canvas-level
  default connection font.

Edge labels, portal icons, and portal text **inherit** the owning
edge's font today — there is no per-channel `font_family` slot on
`EdgeLabelConfig` or `PortalEndpointState`. A future commit may
add those slots when the graphical font picker calls for it.

## Family-name semantics

Each value is a family-name string the renderer resolves through
`baumhard::font::fonts::app_font_by_family` to the build-time
`AppFont` enum. The `AppFont` is then carried on the
[`ColorFontRegion`](../lib/baumhard/src/core/primitives.rs) the
tree builder hands to the renderer, and pinned via the baumhard
attrs builder.

- **Empty string** on `TextRun.font` clears the pin (run uses the
  document default).
- **Null** on `GlyphConnectionConfig.font` clears the override
  (edge inherits the canvas default connection font).
- **Unknown family** at render time logs a `warn!` and falls back
  to monospace — the renderer never panics on a bad family
  (interactive-path invariant per CODE_CONVENTIONS §9).

## Console verbs

Three forms live under one `font` command:

```
font set <family>           # pin the family on the current selection
font list                   # list every loaded family, each in its face
font size=<pt> [min=<pt>] [max=<pt>]    # font-size + clamp triple
```

`font set <family>` mirrors the color-wheel pattern: it dispatches
through the `AcceptsFontFamily` trait on `TargetView` so each
component variant decides which channel a channel-less font choice
lands on.

| Selection variant | Channel `font set` writes |
|-------------------|---------------------------|
| `Node`            | every `TextRun.font` on the node |
| `Edge`            | `glyph_connection.font` on the edge |
| `PortalLabel`     | the owning edge's `glyph_connection.font` (icon shares edge body's font) |
| `EdgeLabel`       | not applicable (inherits the edge's font) |
| `PortalText`      | not applicable (inherits the edge's font) |

`font list` emits one scrollback line per loaded family, each
shaped in its own face — a quick visual reference for picking.
The console scrollback is scrollable (Shift+Up/Down, PgUp/PgDn,
mousewheel, Shift+Home/End) so the full list is reachable even
when it overflows the visible window.

## Completion

When the cursor sits in the family slot of `font set ...`, the
console completion popup shows every family whose name starts
with the typed prefix (case-insensitive), each candidate row
pre-shaped in that very face. Submitting a candidate writes the
canonical family-name string back to the data model.

## Cross-platform

The data-model fields, the `set_node_font_family` /
`set_edge_font_family` document setters, the `AcceptsFontFamily`
trait, and the `list_loaded_families` enumeration helper all
compile and apply on `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. The `font` console
verb itself is native-only by inheritance — the console UI is
native-only — but a future graphical font picker can attach to
the same primitives without re-doing the foundation.
