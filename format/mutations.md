# Custom Mutations

Custom mutations are named, reusable bundles of operations a mindmap
can attach to nodes or expose through the `mutation` console verb.
They cover everything from "grow every descendant's font by 2pt" to
size-aware layouts like `flower-layout` and `tree-cascade`.

This document is the format reference. For the Rust-side types see
`lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/custom_mutation/`; the loader lives in
`src/application/document/mutations_loader/`.

## Where mutations come from

Four sources contribute to a document's active registry, in
ascending precedence (later writers override earlier ones with the
same `id`):

<!-- SOURCE-OF-TRUTH: the precedence order below is also encoded in
     src/application/document/mutations_loader/mod.rs as the
     MutationSource enum variant order and in the doc comment on
     build_mutation_registry_with_app_and_user. When the order or
     set of sources changes, update all three in the same commit. -->

1. **Application bundle** — `assets/mutations/application.json`,
   compiled into the binary via `include_str!`. Lowest precedence so
   users can customize anything shipped by the app.
2. **User file** — `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/mandala/mutations.json` on
   native (falls back to `$HOME/.config/mandala/mutations.json`);
   `?mutations=<url-encoded-json>` query or
   `localStorage["mandala_mutations"]` on WASM.
3. **Map-level** — the `custom_mutations: [...]` array in the
   `.mindmap.json` file itself.
4. **Inline** — the `inline_mutations: [...]` array on a specific
   `MindNode`.

`mutation help <id>` and `mutation inspect <id>` both report which
layer won the registry slot for that id.

Override-safety note: if a user file redeclares the id of a
bundled mutation that has a registered Rust handler (e.g.
`flower-layout`, `tree-cascade`), the dispatcher **honours the
user's declarative mutator** rather than silently running the
bundled handler's algorithm against the user's scope. See
`MindMapDocument::will_dispatch_to_handler` for the guard.

## JSON shape — start here

Most mutations are pure data: a flat `Vec<Mutation>` applied over a
declared scope. Use this shape:

```json
{
  "mutations": [
    {
      "id": "grow-font-2pt",
      "name": "Grow Font 2pt",
      "description": "Increase font size by 2 points on the selected node and all descendants.",
      "contexts": ["map.node"],
      "mutations": [{ "AreaCommand": { "GrowFont": 2.0 } }],
      "target_scope": "SelfAndDescendants"
    }
  ]
}
```

Drop that at `~/.config/mandala/mutations.json`, restart the app,
and `/` → `mutation list` will show it. `mutation apply grow-font-2pt`
on a node's selection grows the fonts. Three lines of change to
author a new mutation.

Fields the shape above uses:

- `id` — unique key, typed at the console prompt.
- `name` — human-readable name in `mutation list`.
- `description` — first line shown in `mutation list`, expanded by
  `mutation help <id>`.
- `contexts` — dotted tags describing what the mutation touches
  (`map.node`, `map.tree`, `internal`, …). See [contexts](#contexts)
  below.
- `mutations` — a flat `Vec<Mutation>` applied to every node
  covered by `target_scope`. See the [Mutation vocabulary](#mutation-vocabulary)
  section for the variants.
- `predicate` — optional `Predicate` filter gate; defaults to none.
  See [predicate](#predicate--top-level-filter-gate) below.
- `target_scope` — one of `SelfOnly` / `Children` / `Descendants` /
  `SelfAndDescendants` / `Parent` / `Siblings`. Governs both what
  nodes the mutations apply to *and* the undo-snapshot window.

When the legacy shape isn't enough — a mutation that needs
per-child positioning, runtime-computed values, or the
`MapChildren` walker primitive — use the richer [MutatorNode
AST](#mutator--the-mutatornode-ast) form instead of or in addition
to `mutations`. The backward-compat deserializer accepts both
shapes on load; save always emits the canonical `mutator` form.

### Mutation vocabulary

`Mutation` is an enum from `baumhard::gfx_structs::mutator`. The
JSON tag is the variant name; the payload is the variant's inner
value. The most common variants for authoring:

- `{"AreaCommand": { "GrowFont": 2.0 }}` — grow font size by 2pt.
- `{"AreaCommand": { "ShrinkFont": 2.0 }}` — inverse.
- `{"AreaCommand": { "NudgeRight": 50.0 }}` — shift x by 50px.
  Sibling variants: `NudgeLeft`, `NudgeUp`, `NudgeDown`.
- `{"AreaCommand": { "SetFontSize": 18.0 }}` — absolute font size.
- `{"AreaCommand": { "MoveTo": [100.0, 200.0] }}` — absolute x,y.

The full vocabulary lives in
`lib/baumhard/src/gfx_structs/area_mutators.rs` under
`GlyphAreaCommand`. Same enum-variant-as-JSON-tag convention.

### Document-actions-only mutation

A mutation can carry only canvas-level work (e.g. a theme switch)
with no tree effect at all. Omit `mutator` and `mutations`, keep
`target_scope` as a formal placeholder:

```json
{
  "id": "switch-dark",
  "name": "Switch to dark theme",
  "description": "Copy the 'dark' theme variant into live variables.",
  "contexts": ["map.node"],
  "target_scope": "SelfOnly",
  "document_actions": [{ "SetThemeVariant": "dark" }]
}
```

`UndoAction::CanvasSnapshot` captures the pre-action canvas state
so `Ctrl+Z` reverses it.

## Fields

| Field | Type | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|---|
| `id` | string | — | Unique key in the registry. `mutation apply <id>` and trigger bindings reference it. |
| `name` | string | — | Human-readable name shown in `mutation list`. |
| `description` | string | `""` | One- or multi-line explanation shown in `mutation list` (first line) and expanded by `mutation help <id>`. |
| `contexts` | string[] | `[]` | Dotted-namespace tags describing where and what the mutation operates on. See `contexts` below. Empty is treated as `["internal"]`. |
| `mutator` | MutatorNode \| null | `null` | The mutation payload. `null` is valid for mutations that only ship `document_actions`. |
| `target_scope` | enum | — | Which nodes the undo path snapshots. See `target_scope` below. |
| `behavior` | `Persistent` \| `Toggle` | `Persistent` | Whether the mutation commits to the model (`Persistent`) or only updates the tree visually and reverses on re-trigger (`Toggle`). |
| `predicate` | Predicate \| null | `null` | Optional filter — elements not matching the predicate are skipped. |
| `document_actions` | DocumentAction[] | `[]` | Canvas-level actions (theme switches, etc.) that fire alongside the tree mutation. |
| `timing` | AnimationTiming \| null | `null` | When present with `duration_ms > 0`, the mutation interpolates over time instead of landing instantly. |

## `contexts`

Tags describing where and on what the mutation is meant to run.
Follows the named-string convention from `enums.md`: unknown tags
are preserved on round-trip but don't match any well-known
predicate.

Well-known tags (defined in
`lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/custom_mutation/contexts.rs`):

- `internal` — an implementation-detail mutation registered by the
  host application for its own use. Not listed by `mutation list`
  and refused by `mutation apply`. An empty `contexts` array is
  equivalent to `["internal"]`.
- `map` — operates on a mindmap. Root of the `map.*` sub-namespace.
- `map.node` — touches the content of a single node (text, style,
  color, regions).
- `map.tree` — touches tree structure / layout descending from a
  node (positions, children arrangement).

Plugins reserve the `plugin.<name>.<kind>` namespace. `mutation list`
filters to entries whose contexts include anything starting with
`map`; `mutation list --all` drops that filter.

## `target_scope`

Scopes the **undo snapshot and model-sync** windows, **not** the
mutator payload's reach. The mutator AST is free to walk wherever its
control-flow dictates; `target_scope` tells the framework which model
nodes to clone into the `UndoAction::CustomMutation` snapshot before
the mutation runs and (for non-handler mutations) which nodes to sync
from the tree back to the model afterward. A mutation author's job is
to keep the declared scope a superset of the nodes the mutator
actually touches — if the mutator writes outside this scope, those
writes won't be reverted by `Ctrl+Z` and won't reach the saved model.

| Value | Nodes snapshotted / synced |
|---|---|
| `SelfOnly` | The anchor node. |
| `Children` | Direct children of the anchor. |
| `Descendants` | All descendants recursively (not the anchor). |
| `SelfAndDescendants` | Anchor + all descendants. |
| `Parent` | The anchor's parent node. |
| `Siblings` | The anchor's siblings (excluding itself). |
| `SectionsOnly` | Every section of the anchor — bypasses the chrome-only container fan-out so text / font / region mutations land on the section-areas only. The anchor `MindNode` is still the snapshot window (whole-node clone covers per-section state). Use this when a mutation must avoid colliding with a sibling mind-node sharing the section's channel. |

For scope-helper-generated MutatorNodes (via
`baumhard::mindmap::custom_mutation::scope::*`) the helper name
matches the `target_scope` value — `scope::self_and_descendants(...)`
pairs with `SelfAndDescendants`, etc. For hand-authored MutatorNodes,
pick the smallest scope that covers every node the AST will touch.

## `predicate` — top-level filter gate

Optional `Predicate` that narrows the candidate elements
*before* the mutator's `Macro` payload lands on each target.
When present, every element in the `target_scope`-collected
fan-out (the chrome-only container plus each section-area) is
tested against `predicate.test(element)`; mutations only land on
elements that match.

The shape mirrors the predicates used inside
`Instruction::RepeatWhile` — same struct, same field language —
so authors don't learn two filtering grammars. Per-grapheme /
per-region targeting still happens inside the mutator AST; the
top-level `predicate` is the *element-level* filter ("does this
GlyphArea / GlyphModel even count?").

The predicate field language exposes `GfxElementField::Flag(Flag)`
for the most common authoring shape — "match elements with this
flag set / clear". The `Flag` variants are:

| Variant | Set on |
|---|---|
| `Focused` | Element holds keyboard / interaction focus. |
| `Mutable` | Element accepts user-driven mutation. |
| `Anchored(AnchorBox)` | Element is layout-pinned. |
| `MutationEvents` | Element generates events on mutation. |
| `SectionRoot` | Element is part of a section subtree (section-area or section-model). |

Common idioms:

- `Predicate { fields: [(Flag(SectionRoot), Equals(false))], always_match: false }`
  — "land on sections only" (filters the container out).
  Same end-state as `target_scope: SectionsOnly` for a
  `SelfOnly`-style mutator; the structural scope is preferred
  when authoring intent is "sections, never the chrome".
- `Predicate { fields: [(Flag(SectionRoot), Equals(true))], … }`
  — the inverse: "land on the container only, skip every
  section." Useful for chrome-only mutations (background,
  border) that shouldn't touch the section glyphs.

`predicate` is `null` (or absent) by default — every candidate
element passes through unfiltered. The field round-trips through
serde with `skip_serializing_if = "Option::is_none"`, so
mutations that don't filter stay byte-identical on disk.

## `mutator` — the MutatorNode AST

The mutator AST mirrors Baumhard's `GfxMutator` variants plus a
`Repeat` wrapper for "N children at consecutive channels". See
`lib/baumhard/src/mutator_builder/ast.rs` for the type definitions.
Four top-level variants:

- **`Void`** — structural grouping, no mutation. Walks children.
- **`Single { channel, mutation }`** — one mutation at one channel.
- **`Macro { channel, mutations, children }`** — a flat list of
  mutations applied to the matched target. `mutations` is
  `{ "Literal": [...] }` for baked-in values or
  `{ "Runtime": "<label>" }` for runtime-supplied values. `children`
  default to empty; used by the `SelfAndDescendants` scope topology
  (a Macro on the anchor whose child is an `Instruction` walking
  descendants).
- **`Instruction { channel, instruction, children }`** — control
  flow wrapping inner children. Instructions:
  - `RepeatWhileAlwaysTrue` — apply children to every descendant.
  - `RepeatWhile(<Predicate>)` — apply children to every descendant
    for which the predicate holds, short-circuit once it fails.
  - `RotateWhile(<f32>, <Predicate>)` — rotation stub (reserved).
  - `SpatialDescend(<OrderedVec2>)` — descend by AABB containment to
    the deepest node that holds the point, deliver the instruction's
    attached mutation.
  - `MapChildren` — **zip-by-sibling-position**. Pairs the
    mutator's direct children with the target's direct children
    by index, **bypassing channel alignment**. See "MapChildren"
    below.
- **`Repeat { section, channel_base, count, skip_indices, template }`**
  — expands at build time into N children at consecutive channels,
  each derived from `template`. `count` is `{ "Literal": N }` or
  `{ "Runtime": "<label>" }`. Used by widgets (the picker's hue
  ring) and any runtime-shaped section.

### Channel alignment vs. `MapChildren`

By default, the walker pairs a mutator's direct children with a
target's direct children **by matching the `channel` field on
each element** — see `format/channels.md`. This is broadcast
semantics: one mutator on channel N hits every target child that
happens to share channel N. It's the right default for groups.

`Instruction::MapChildren` is the opt-in alternative: it pairs
strictly by **sibling position** (zip), ignoring channels entirely.
This is the shape size-aware layouts want — the `i`-th target child
gets the `i`-th mutator child, regardless of how channels are
assigned. A typical declarative layout pairs `MapChildren` with a
`Repeat` expansion fed by a `SectionContext`:

```json
{
  "Instruction": {
    "channel": 0,
    "instruction": "MapChildren",
    "children": [{
      "Repeat": {
        "section": "children",
        "channel_base": 0,
        "count": { "Runtime": "children" },
        "template": {
          "Single": {
            "channel": "SectionIndex",
            "mutation": { "AreaDelta": ["position"] }
          }
        }
      }
    }]
  }
}
```

At apply time the registered `SectionContext` supplies
`count("children") = N` and per-index
`field("children", i, &CellField::position)`; the walker expands the
`Repeat` into N `Single` mutators and `MapChildren` zips them against
the N target children.

### Runtime holes

A MutatorNode may embed runtime variants (`Runtime`, `AreaDelta`
with `CellField`s fed from the area lookup). At apply time the
walker consults a `SectionContext` registered by the host
application for the mutation's `id`. Pure-data mutations (no runtime
holes) use a no-op context.

### Imperative handlers vs. declarative mutators

Two apply paths coexist:

- **Declarative (`mutator: Some(MutatorNode)`)** — the walker
  compiles the AST to a `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>` and walks it over
  the Baumhard tree. The framework syncs mutated nodes back from the
  tree to the model for undo. Runtime holes are resolved via a
  `SectionContext` keyed on the mutation `id`. Preferred for
  mutations expressible in the AST (pure-data field changes,
  MapChildren-shaped per-index layouts, predicate-gated recursion).
- **Imperative (`DynamicMutationHandler`)** — a Rust function
  pointer registered on the document under the mutation `id`. When
  present, the dispatcher calls the handler directly and it mutates
  the `MindMap` model in place, bypassing the tree walk. Chosen for
  mutations too structural for the AST (arbitrary BFS layouts,
  anything that needs per-node custom computation spanning multiple
  passes). The mutator field in the JSON is conventionally empty
  (`"mutations": []` in the legacy shape, or `mutator: null`).

Decision rule: reach for the declarative path first. Move to a
handler when the AST gets contorted — typically when you find
yourself wanting per-target state that `SectionContext` can't
cleanly express, or multiple tree passes. `flower_layout.rs` and
`tree_cascade.rs` under `src/application/document/mutations/` are
the canonical handler examples; both are registered by
`register_builtin_handlers` at startup.

## Firing mutations from interaction

The `mutation` console verb is one way to fire a mutation. The
other is a trigger binding: a mutation id attached to a node's
`trigger_bindings` array, fired when the user clicks, hovers, or
presses a bound key on that node. The binding JSON shape lives on
the node, not on the mutation:

```json
{
  "id": "0",
  "parent_id": null,
  "text": "Root",
  "trigger_bindings": [
    { "trigger": "OnClick", "mutation_id": "switch-dark" },
    { "trigger": "OnHover", "mutation_id": "highlight-red",
      "contexts": ["Desktop"] }
  ]
}
```

Valid triggers: `OnClick`, `OnHover`, `{"OnKey": "<key>"}`,
`{"OnLink": "<href>"}`. The optional `contexts` field limits the
binding to particular runtime platforms (`Desktop` / `Web` /
`Touch`); omit it to fire on all platforms.

Trigger bindings respect `MutationBehavior::Toggle` semantics —
click the same node twice on a Toggle-flavoured mutation to
reverse it. See `format/schema.md` for the full node field
reference.

## Authoring a user file

Drop a JSON file at `~/.config/mandala/mutations.json` with the
envelope shape above. The file is read at startup; `log::info!`
reports the count on success, `log::warn!` on parse failure.
Malformed files don't crash the app — the layer is skipped and the
app bundle below continues to load.

A user mutation whose `id` matches an app-bundled mutation overrides
the bundle — useful for tweaking constants without rebuilding. A
map-level mutation in turn overrides the user's, and an inline
mutation on a specific node overrides the map's.
