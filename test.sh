Usage: ./test.sh [--coverage] [--lint] [--bench] [--help]

  (no flags)   Run the full test suite across every workspace member
               (mandala, baumhard, mandala_derive, maptool), then
               type-check the benchmark targets and the WASM target so
               neither can rot silently between merges.
  --coverage   Run the suite under cargo-llvm-cov and emit HTML + LCOV.
  --lint       Also run cargo fmt --check and cargo clippy (advisory, never fails the run).
  --bench      Also *run* cargo bench after tests pass. Maintainers
               only — AGENTS.md forbids automated agents this flag.
               The unconditional bench type-check needs no flag.
  --help       Show this message.

# so `cargo test` cannot notice when one is renamed
# (lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md §B8). §B8 names `cargo bench` and
# `./test.sh --bench` as the two mechanisms that would — and AGENTS.md
# forbids both. `autobenches = false` removed even the accidental net of
# cargo compiling a stray `benches/*.rs`. Without this line, a renamed
# `do_*()` breaks the bench file and no green run anywhere reports it.

# baumhard's cross-platform discipline (`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md`)
# is also enforced here — a native-only addition to baumhard would
# otherwise fail the eventual `trunk build` without failing the tests.
# `cargo check` is deliberately cheap — full `trunk build` belongs in

# installed so contributors who haven't run
