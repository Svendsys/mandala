Usage: ./test.sh [--coverage] [--lint] [--bench] [--help]

  (no flags)   Run the full test suite across every workspace member
               (mandala, baumhard, mandala_derive, maptool), then
               type-check the benchmark targets and the WASM target so
               neither can rot silently between merges.
  --coverage   Run the suite under cargo-llvm-cov and emit HTML + LCOV.
  --lint       Also run cargo fmt --check, cargo clippy and cargo doc.
               fmt and both doc legs (host: --workspace with private
               items; wasm32: -p mandala) are hard gates: their
               baselines are zero (#130, #134), so a regression prints
               a FAILED: line and the run exits non-zero at the end,
               after every other gate has reported. clippy is advisory
               until its warning baseline is zero. fmt runs once — rustfmt
               parses rather than compiles, so it is target-independent.
               clippy and doc run twice, on the host target *and* on
               wasm32-unknown-unknown: a host-target compile drops
               everything under #[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")], so the
               browser half of the app — its lints and its intra-doc
               links alike — is invisible without the second leg. The
               wasm32 legs are skipped with a note when the target
               isn't installed.
  --bench      Also *run* cargo bench after tests pass. Maintainers
               only — AGENTS.md forbids automated agents this flag.
               The unconditional bench type-check needs no flag.
  --help       Show this message.
