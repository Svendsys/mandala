# Test Conventions

## §T1 Test fundamentals first, and test them heavily

Fundamentals get the heaviest coverage in the repository. These are
the surfaces every other piece of code rests on, and a regression in
one of them ripples into everything above it.

The fundamentals are:

- **Mutations and undo round-trips** — every `GfxMutator` variant,
  every `UndoAction` variant, every forward-and-back. A mutation that
  cannot be undone correctly is a corruption waiting to happen.
- **Unicode and grapheme handling** — every primitive in
  `lib/baumhard/src/util/grapheme_chad.rs`. Emoji, combining marks,
  regional indicators, ZWJ sequences. Test the surprising inputs
  before the obvious ones.
- **Geometry and region indexing** — `almost_equal` /
  `almost_equal_vec2`, `RegionIndexer`, the region params math.
  Every spatial-index assertion is a frame that does not stutter under
  selection.
- **Loader edges** — every shape `.mindmap.json` can take, including
  malformed ones, missing fields, and unknown `edge_type` values.
- **Platform-shared logic** — gesture math, viewport math, anything
  that has to behave identically on native and WASM.

Features built on top of the fundamentals get coverage proportional to
their user impact, but **never less than the happy path plus each
distinct error path**. When in doubt, write the test (§T12).

## §T2 Where tests live

Two patterns coexist, and both are intentional.

### §T2.1 Inline `#[cfg(test)] mod tests` — the default

Most test modules live inline at the bottom of the source file they
test, wrapped in `#[cfg(test)] mod tests { ... }`. This is the default
pattern for anything that does not need to be called from outside the
test harness.

Representative exemplars:
- `src/application/document.rs` — fundamentals coverage of
  hit-testing, selection, undo stacks, portal mutations.
- `lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/scene_builder.rs` — connection and border
  rendering math.
- `lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/connection.rs` — anchor points, path
  sampling, Bezier curves.

If you are not sure where a new test should go, put it inline.

### §T2.2 `pub mod tests;` trees — Baumhard-only, benchmark-reusable

In `lib/baumhard`, certain modules expose tests through a dedicated
`tests` subdirectory declared as `pub mod tests;` rather than
`#[cfg(test)] mod tests`. This is deliberate and load-bearing: the
benchmark harness at `lib/baumhard/benches/test_bench.rs` imports the
test bodies so criterion can run them as micro-benchmarks.

If the module were gated with `#[cfg(test)]`, the benchmark binary
(which is not compiled under `cfg(test)`) could not reach it. So we
make the test module `pub` and rely on the `do_*()` / `test_*()`
naming split (see §T3) to keep `#[test]`-annotated wrapper functions
out of the benchmark import path.

Do not "fix" the missing `#[cfg(test)]`. It is the way.

Exemplars:
- `lib/baumhard/src/util/tests/` — geometry, color, grapheme, arena,
  primes (file is `primes_test.rs`; the singular suffix is a known
  inconsistency).
- `lib/baumhard/src/gfx_structs/tests/` — region, tree, model, area,
  walker.
- `lib/baumhard/src/core/tests/` — primitives (ranges, color regions).

### §T2.3 Cross-crate rule

The `pub mod tests;` pattern is Baumhard-only. The `mandala` crate has
no benchmark harness, so there is no reason to ever reach for it
there — every mandala-side test lives inline.

## §T3 Naming

- **Test functions:** `test_<topic>_<specific_case>`. Lowercase
  snake_case. Examples: `test_hit_test_direct_hit`,
  `test_portal_label_gap_reuse`.

- **Benchmark-reusable bodies:** `pub fn do_<topic>_<case>()`, with a
  one-line `#[test] fn test_<topic>_<case>()` wrapper that calls it.
  The `do_*` function is `pub` so it is reachable from
  `benches/test_bench.rs`. Exemplar from
  `lib/baumhard/src/util/tests/geometry_tests.rs`:

  ```rust
  #[test]
  fn test_90_deg_rotation() {
      do_90_deg_rotation();
  }

  pub fn do_90_deg_rotation() {
      let point = Vec2::new(1.0, 0.0);
      let pivot = Vec2::new(0.0, 0.0);
      let rotated = clockwise_rotation_around_pivot(point, pivot, 90.0);
      let expected = Vec2::new(0.0, -1.0);
      assert!(almost_equal_vec2(rotated, expected));
  }
  ```

- **Fixture helpers:** free functions inside `mod tests { ... }`,
  named by what they return. See `load_test_doc` / `load_test_tree` /
  `test_map_path` in `src/application/document.rs`.

- **Lazy-static test data:** `TEST_<NOUN>` in SCREAMING_SNAKE. Pattern
  is in `lib/baumhard/src/gfx_structs/tests/region_tests.rs` and
  `lib/baumhard/src/core/tests/primitives_tests.rs`.

## §T4 Fixtures and test data

- `maps/testament.mindmap.json` is the canonical fixture. Prefer
  loading it through the `load_test_doc()` / `load_test_tree()`
  helpers over hand-constructing `MindMap` literals. A test that
  exercises the loader path at the same time as the feature under
  test catches more regressions for free.

- Build fixture paths with `env!("CARGO_MANIFEST_DIR")` so tests work
  regardless of working directory. The pattern lives in
  `src/application/document.rs`'s test module.

- For heavy repeated data (large region tables, primitive truth
  tables), declare it once per test module via `lazy_static!`. See
  `primitives_tests.rs::OVERLAPS_TEST` and `region_tests.rs` for the
  shape.

- New fixture mindmaps go in `maps/` with a `*.mindmap.json` suffix so
  the build-script walker and the CLI loader both handle them
  uniformly.

## §T5 Assertions

- **Plain `assert!` / `assert_eq!` are the house style.** No
  `pretty_assertions`, no `insta`, no snapshot testing. If a diff is
  hard to read, improve the values you are comparing, not the
  assertion macro.

- **Floating-point and glyph-space geometry** use `almost_equal` and
  `almost_equal_vec2` from `lib/baumhard/src/util/geometry.rs`. Pick
  an epsilon that matches the scale of the value under test — the
  helpers default to a reasonable scale-invariant tolerance, but do
  not trust them blindly for very large or very small values.

- **Panics:** prefer `assert!(matches!(result, Err(_)))` or explicit
  `assert_eq!(result.unwrap_err(), ...)` for fallible APIs. Bare
  `#[should_panic]` is acceptable when a constructor enforces an
  invariant by panicking (see `region_tests.rs`'s RegionParams
  prime-dimension tests for the shape). When the panic message itself
  is load-bearing — i.e. the test exists to verify the message — use
  `#[should_panic(expected = "...")]` so a future reword cannot
  silently weaken the test.

## §T6 Benchmark-reuse discipline

Any `do_*()` function exported through a `pub mod tests;` tree is part
of `lib/baumhard/benches/test_bench.rs`'s surface. Renaming or
removing one is a two-file change — update the benchmark imports in
the same commit. This is not enforced by the compiler (the benchmark
file is not built unless you run `cargo bench` or `./test.sh
--bench`), so keep them in sync by convention.

## §T7 When to add a regression test

Any of these triggers a test in the same commit:

- A new mutation or undo variant — especially if it touches tree
  structure or reparenting logic.
- A new loader path or loader edge case.
- A scene-builder math path that decides where a glyph lands.
- A reported bug — write the test first, name it after the symptom,
  then fix the bug.
- Anything you catch yourself re-verifying by hand across sessions.
  That manual check is a regression test begging to be written.
- Any change to a fundamental (§T1). Touching a fundamental without
  adding to its test surface is technical debt, and §5 of
  [`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`](./CODE_CONVENTIONS.md) does not tolerate
  technical debt.

## §T8 GPU and renderer testing

We do **not** exercise `Renderer::new`, the wgpu device/queue,
cosmic-text rasterization, or any live GPU code path in tests. The
renderer is constructed once at app startup and never in a test
harness. Standing up a headless wgpu instance for tests is a tar pit.

What we *do* test from the renderer is the pure layout math — cull
rects, palette frame sizing, palette scroll windows, sacred-border
layout, backdrop alignment. See `application::renderer::tests` for the
exemplar. If a bug requires a live wgpu device to reproduce, note it
in `TODO.md`'s "What needs work" list rather than building a
headless harness to chase it.

## §T9 Mobile and WASM

The cross-platform reality (see
[`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md §4`](./CODE_CONVENTIONS.md) and §3) shapes how
we test for non-native targets.

- **Tests run on native.** `./test.sh` exercises the entire suite
  against the host target. Platform-shared logic that passes on
  native is trusted to pass on WASM, because the logic does not
  depend on the platform.
- **`build.sh` validates the wasm32 cross-compile.** A change that
  builds for native but breaks `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is a
  regression caught at build time, not runtime.
- **Pure platform-shared logic must be reachable without a wgpu
  instance.** Touch-input math, gesture recognition, viewport math,
  hit-test math — anything that has to behave identically on a
  desktop and a phone — lives in functions that take their inputs as
  plain values and return plain values. This is an architectural
  constraint cross-referenced in
  [`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md §3`](./CODE_CONVENTIONS.md): code that only
  works inside a `wgpu::Device` cannot be tested for cross-platform
  correctness, and code that cannot be tested for cross-platform
  correctness will eventually diverge between platforms.
- **No `wasm-bindgen-test`.** Cross-platform logic is tested once on
  native; WASM-specific code paths are validated by `build.sh`
  compiling for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`.

## §T10 What we deliberately don't do

These are not accidental omissions — each is a decision. Do not
re-litigate them without a strong reason.

- **No `pretty_assertions`, no `insta`, no snapshot testing.** Plain
  assertions, always.
- **No `mockall` or hand-rolled trait mocks.** Tests construct real
  objects and real data. The codebase is small enough that this works.
- **No async test harness.** The app is single-threaded (see
  `CLAUDE.md`). Tests stay that way.
- **No `wasm-bindgen-test`.** See §T9.
- **No GPU / live-wgpu test infrastructure.** See §T8.
- **No CI yet.** `./test.sh` is the covenant — run it before
  committing.

## §T11 Running the suite

- `./test.sh` — full suite across `baumhard` and `mandala`; prints a
  test count at the end.
- `./test.sh --coverage` — runs under `cargo-llvm-cov` (install with
  `cargo install cargo-llvm-cov`). HTML at
  `target/llvm-cov/html/index.html`, LCOV at
  `target/llvm-cov/lcov.info`.
- `./test.sh --lint` — also runs `cargo fmt --check` and
  `cargo clippy --workspace --all-targets`. Both advisory; review
  output but they do not fail the run.
- `./test.sh --bench` — also runs `cargo bench` after tests pass.
- `cargo test -p baumhard --lib <pattern>` or
  `cargo test -p mandala --lib <pattern>` — targeted subset while
  iterating.
- `cargo doc -p baumhard --no-deps` — render the library docs and
  spot-check that every `pub` item has the doc comment
  [`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md §B9`](./lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md)
  requires.

## §T12 Test aggressively

When in doubt, write the test. An untested fundamental is technical
debt (§T1, §T7), and a featureful path with no error-case coverage is
half a feature.
