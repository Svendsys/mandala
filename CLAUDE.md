# CLAUDE.md

Durable orientation notes for Claude Code sessions working on this repo.
Not a spec, not a recipe — just the stuff a new session tends to benefit
from knowing before diving in.

## What this is

Mandala is a Rust mindmap application built on wgpu and cosmic-text, using
the Baumhard glyph-animation library under `lib/baumhard`. It runs on both
native desktop and as a WebAssembly build. `.mindmap.json` files are loaded
and rendered as interactive canvases where every visual element — text,
borders, connection paths — is laid out as positioned font glyphs.

## Where to look first

- **`CONCEPTS.md`** — the conceptual building-blocks reference: what
  each named concept (`GlyphArea`, `MutatorTree`, `Channel`, `Portal`,
  `ZoomVisibility`, `CustomMutation`, ...) is, what problem it solves,
  and where it lives. Start here when a term is unfamiliar or for a
  top-down orientation across both crates.
- **`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md`** — the workspace-wide coding spec:
  architectural invariants, how to use baumhard, complexity and KISS
  heuristics, error-handling posture, and documentation standards.
  Prescriptive where `CLAUDE.md` is descriptive.
- **`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md`** — crate-local rules for baumhard:
  mutation-not-rebuild, grapheme-aware text, arena discipline,
  benchmark-reuse, no-unsafe policy, and performance rules. Read this
  before touching anything under `lib/baumhard/`.
- **`TEST_CONVENTIONS.md`** — testing philosophy, where to put tests, the
  `do_*()` benchmark-reuse pattern, and what we deliberately don't do
  (no mocks, no snapshots, no GPU tests).
- **`format/`** — the `.mindmap.json` format specification.
  `format/schema.md` is the primary reference; per-concept docs cover
  Dewey-decimal IDs, named enums, palettes, channels, text runs,
  validation invariants, portal labels, mutations, and migration from
  legacy. Read this before changing the data model.
- **`crates/maptool/`** — CLI tool for working with `.mindmap.json`
  files: `show`, `grep`, `apply`, `export`, `convert --legacy`
  (migration from miMind-derived format), and `verify` (structural
  validation).
- **`lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/`** — the data model, loaders, scene
  builders, and the tree bridge. Most interesting logic lives here.
- **`src/application/`** — the app shell: event loop, document state,
  rendering pipeline, and input handling.

## Architectural shape (high level)

Invariants live in `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md §3` — this section is the shape,
not the rules.

- **Single-threaded, with a clean model/view split.** The event loop
  owns the `Renderer` directly; `MindMapDocument` owns the data model
  (`MindMap`, selection, undo stack) and hands the renderer intermediate
  representations to draw from. No channels, no worker threads for app
  logic. One disciplined exception: native builds run a freeze
  watchdog on a background thread
  (`src/application/app/freeze_watchdog.rs`). The watchdog only
  reads a shared `AtomicU64` timestamp the main loop pings — it
  never touches app state — so the single-threaded invariant for
  the model/view pipeline is preserved.
- **Render through the Baumhard tree.** Nodes / connections /
  borders / portals all flow toward
  `Tree<GfxElement, GfxMutator>` and are walked into cosmic-text
  buffers by `src/application/renderer/tree_walker.rs`. Some
  legacy element types still pass through a flat scene
  intermediary (`scene_builder/`) on their way to that walker;
  treat that as a seam in flight, not a permanent second
  pipeline. New visuals belong in the Baumhard tree.
- **Mutation-first interaction model.** Where a user action can be
  expressed as a mutation cascading through the Baumhard tree, prefer
  that. Things outside the tree — edges, borders, overlays — reach the
  scene builder or renderer directly.
- **Unified throttled-interaction seam.** Every continuous,
  high-rate-input-driven mutation (node drag, edge-handle drag,
  portal-label drag, edge-label drag, color-picker hover) flows
  through the `ThrottledInteraction` trait in
  `src/application/app/throttled_interaction/`. The trait's default
  `drive` method is the adaptive-throttle shell — input is accepted
  every tick, but the *application* of mutations is gated by a
  per-interaction `MutationFrequencyThrottle`. New throttled
  components ship as one struct + one trait impl + one
  `ThrottledDrag` variant; the drain dispatcher never grows. Scope
  is continuous interactive paths only; one-shots (console
  commands, `apply_custom_mutation`) and paths gated by their own
  dirty flags (camera geometry rebuild, animation tick) stay on
  their existing synchronous call paths. See
  `src/application/frame_throttle.rs` for the throttle primitive
  and `src/application/app/throttled_interaction/mod.rs` for the
  trait.
- **Cross-platform reality.** Almost everything that works on native
  also compiles for wasm32. Native-only code sits behind
  `#[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))]`; WASM-only behind
  `#[cfg(target_arch = "wasm32")]`. WASM also falls back to WebGL2
  (via `wgpu`'s `webgl` feature) on browsers without WebGPU. The WASM
  input path currently lags behind native — see **Dual-target status**
  below for the precise surface.

## Dual-target status

Mandala is built for native desktop (`cargo run`, primary dev loop) and
WASM (`trunk serve` / `trunk build` — same binary on desktop and mobile
browsers). Per `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md §4` the two targets are equal
citizens; this section tracks the current parity surface so a new
session doesn't have to trawl `#[cfg]` guards to learn what works where.

**Runs on both targets:**
- Pluggable node shapes (rectangle, ellipse) for background fill +
  hit-testing. One `NodeShape` enum in
  `lib/baumhard/src/gfx_structs/shape.rs` drives both the rect
  pipeline's SDF fragment shader and the BVH descent. Adding a shape
  is localised: one enum variant + one WGSL `case` + one
  `contains_local` arm. See `format/enums.md#styleshape`.
- Zoom-visibility bounds on every renderable component — nodes,
  edges, edge labels, portal endpoints (icon + text), and node
  borders (which inherit from the owning node). The `ZoomVisibility`
  primitive in `lib/baumhard/src/gfx_structs/zoom_visibility.rs`
  gates presence on `camera.zoom` via an optional inclusive `[min,
  max]` window. Defaults unbounded, so existing maps render
  unchanged. JSON surface is two flat optional fields
  (`min_zoom_to_render` / `max_zoom_to_render`) on `MindNode`,
  `MindEdge`, `EdgeLabelConfig`, `PortalEndpointState` — cascade is
  replace-not-intersect (label / endpoint override fully replaces
  the edge window when either bound is set). The cull runs
  alongside the existing spatial `Camera2D::is_visible` in
  `src/application/renderer/render.rs` — two branchless float
  compares per `MindMapTextBuffer`, zero cosmic-text shaping or
  buffer-cache invalidation on zoom steps. Mutator target:
  `GlyphAreaField::ZoomVisibility` for zoom-triggered LOD
  transitions. Runtime authoring via the `zoom` / `visibility`
  console command (`zoom min=1.5 max=3.0`, `zoom clear`,
  `zoom max=unset`) routing against the active selection
  through `MindMapDocument::set_{node,edge,edge_label,portal_endpoint}_zoom_visibility`
  with `ZoomBoundEdit::{Keep, Clear, Set(f32)}` on each side.
  See `format/zoom-bounds.md`.
- Document model, scene builder, tree bridge — all of `MindMapDocument`
  and `baumhard::mindmap::*`.
- Inline node text editor: double-click / Enter / Backspace to open,
  full keyboard flow (cursor, delete, insert, multi-line), click-outside
  to commit, Esc to cancel. Shared implementation under
  `src/application/app/text_edit/`.
- Portal-mode edges (`display_mode = "portal"`): two glyph labels, one
  per endpoint, each carrying a `PortalEndpointState` (color override,
  pinned `border_t` position, signed `perpendicular_offset` along the
  border's outward normal, adjacent text + independent text color /
  font clamps). Single-click on the icon selects
  `SelectionState::PortalLabel`; single-click on the adjacent text
  selects `SelectionState::PortalText`; double-click on either pans
  to the opposite endpoint. Icon vs. text routes through separate
  renderer hitbox maps (`portal_icon_hitboxes` /
  `portal_text_hitboxes`) so per-channel operations (color / font
  via `color text=`, `font min=`, `font max=`) target the clicked
  sub-part. Dispatch wired in `event_mouse_click.rs` (native) and
  `run_wasm.rs` via the shared `ClickHit::{PortalMarker, PortalText}`
  paths. See `format/portal-labels.md`.
- Edge-adjacent selection variants `SelectionState::{EdgeLabel,
  PortalText}` (alongside `Edge` and `PortalLabel`). Each variant
  carries its own clipboard / color / font channel: clipboard
  copy/cut/paste on every edge-adjacent selection operates on the
  resolved color hex of that channel (body, label, icon, or text),
  and `font size= min= max=` writes to the independent font clamps
  on the corresponding config (`glyph_connection.*`,
  `label_config.*`, or `PortalEndpointState.text_*`). Single-click
  on an edge label AABB selects the label and tints it cyan via
  the same `SceneSelectionContext::edge_label` channel the
  scene_builder paints whole-edge selections with; double-click,
  the `EditSelection` action, or simply typing a printable key
  while the selection is active opens the inline editor
  (`open_label_edit` on native; WASM currently just commits the
  selection — editor-on-WASM is a follow-up). Console
  `label position_t=<f32>` / `label perpendicular=<f32>` mirror the
  edge-label drag so WASM users can position labels without drag,
  and dispatch on portal selections too — `position_t=` writes
  `PortalEndpointState.border_t`, `perpendicular=` writes the new
  `perpendicular_offset` field. `edge reset=position` clears the
  position overrides on whichever selection is active (line edge
  → anchors back to "auto" + label position cleared; portal whole
  edge → both endpoints' `border_t` + `perpendicular_offset`
  cleared; single portal endpoint selection → only that side).
- `connection::closest_point_on_path` — Baumhard primitive that
  projects a cursor `Vec2` onto a `ConnectionPath` (straight or
  cubic) and returns `(position_t, perpendicular_offset)`.
  Straight case is direct segment projection; cubic case uses
  uniform-t sampling + Newton refinement with a seed-vs-refined
  fallback. Used by the native `DragState::DraggingEdgeLabel` and
  by the cross-platform `label position_t=` / `label
  perpendicular=` console keys — the drag is native-only, but the
  primitive it composes is cross-target and available for any
  future WASM gesture that needs the same math.
- Action dispatch: the keybind → action pipeline fires on both targets.
  Representative actions include `Undo`, `CreateOrphanNode`,
  `DeleteSelection`, `EditSelection`, `CancelMode`; the full enum lives
  in `src/application/keybinds/action.rs`.
- Keybind config loading — multi-source resolver with platform splits:
  native reads a CLI arg + XDG; WASM reads `?keybinds=…` + `localStorage`.
  `src/application/keybinds/platform_{desktop,web}.rs` is the reference
  pattern for platform-split config loading.
- Mutation framework — the `CustomMutation` carrier, four-source loader
  (`src/application/document/mutations_loader/` with matching
  `platform_{desktop,web}.rs` split), the `MutatorNode` AST + `build`
  walker (`baumhard::mutator_builder`), the channel-bypassing
  `Instruction::MapChildren` walker primitive, and the imperative
  `DynamicMutationHandler` seam for size-aware layouts
  (`src/application/document/mutations/{flower_layout,tree_cascade}.rs`).
  Both `run_native.rs` and `run_wasm.rs` wire the loader + handler
  registry at document-load time. See `format/mutations.md`.
- Cross-platform monotonic clock via `now_ms()` in
  `src/application/app/mod.rs` (native: `Instant`; WASM:
  `performance.now()`).
- Glyph-border configuration: per-node `GlyphBorderConfig` is
  now honoured end-to-end by all three border-build pipelines
  (`scene_builder/node_pass.rs`, `tree_builder/border.rs`, and
  `renderer/scene_buffers.rs`) through the shared
  `baumhard::mindmap::border::resolve_border_style` resolver.
  The four side fields under `glyphs` accept a **side-pattern
  syntax** — atomic-repeat (`+=##=+`) or prefix/fill/suffix
  (`###(*)###`, `+=#(\(\))#=+` with `\(`/`\)`/`\\` escapes),
  parsed by the new `lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/border_pattern.rs`
  module. The four corners stay static glyph strings.
  Optional `color_palette` + `color_palette_field` cycle each
  glyph's colour continuously around the rectangle (top → right
  → bottom → left) through any palette in `MindMap.palettes`,
  reading whichever `ColorGroup` channel the field selects
  (`frame` default, or `background` / `text` / `title`).
  Nodes auto-grow at load time and after every console edit so
  the chosen pattern's static parts always fit
  (`grow_node_sizes_to_fit_borders` in
  `src/application/document/mod.rs`, sibling of the text-fitting
  floor; same monotonic "grow, never shrink" posture). The
  authoring path is the native-only `border` console verb
  (`on` / `off` / `show` / `reset` plus a composable kv form for
  preset / font / size / colour / palette / sides / corners in
  one atomic edit), but the model + parser + resolver + setter
  all compile for `wasm32` so a future WASM gesture can attach
  without rewiring. See `format/border-patterns.md`.
- Per-glyph font-family pinning via `TextRun.font` /
  `GlyphConnectionConfig.font`. Both fields are now honored
  end-to-end — the tree builder
  (`lib/baumhard/src/mindmap/tree_builder/node.rs`) resolves the
  family-name string through
  `baumhard::font::fonts::app_font_by_family` to an `AppFont` and
  threads it onto the `ColorFontRegion`; the baumhard attrs
  builder pins the face. Unknown families log a warning and fall
  back to monospace per §9. The `AcceptsFontFamily` trait on
  `TargetView` is the seam every font-applying surface (console
  command today, graphical picker tomorrow) goes through — see
  `format/fonts.md`. Enumeration helper:
  `baumhard::font::fonts::list_loaded_families`.

**Native-only today** (each is a parity gap, not a style choice):
- Drag gestures: pan, move-node, edge-handle, portal-label, rect-select
  — the entire `DragState` enum is native-gated.
- `AppMode::{Reparent, Connect}` — the mode state machine plus its
  hover preview and click routing.
- Modals: CLI console (`/` trigger), glyph-wheel color picker, edge
  label editor, portal-label text editor. The `mutation` console verb
  (`list` / `apply` / `help` / `inspect`) inherits this scope — the
  loader + registry run on both targets, only the UI shell is native.
  The label / portal-text editors commit on click outside the
  edited target's AABB (mirroring the node text editor); WASM
  reaches the same operations via console verbs. The `font` verb
  also lives in this shell: `font set <family>` pins the font
  family on the current selection through the `AcceptsFontFamily`
  trait, `font list` enumerates loaded families with each row
  shaped in its own face, and the existing `size=`/`min=`/`max=`
  KV form is unchanged. The console scrollback is now scrollable
  (Shift+Up/Down + PgUp/PgDn + Shift+Home/End for the keyboard,
  mousewheel intercepts while the console is open) so large
  outputs like `font list` are reachable end-to-end. The
  `AcceptsFontFamily` trait, the data-model fields, and the
  enumeration helper all compile for `wasm32-unknown-unknown`;
  the WASM gap is the console UI shell, not the font primitives.
  See `format/fonts.md`.
- Hover-based UI: `hovered_node` tracking, cursor-change on button
  nodes, `OnClick` trigger dispatch.
- Clipboard copy/paste — `arboard` on native; WASM `clipboard.rs` stubs
  with `log::warn!`.
- Freeze watchdog — native runs a background thread
  (`src/application/app/freeze_watchdog.rs`) that aborts the
  process with a diagnostic banner if the main loop stalls longer
  than its threshold. WASM gets the browser's built-in
  "unresponsive tab" dialog for free, so no equivalent is wired;
  a Worker-based liveness check can slot in when a concrete need
  arises.
- FPS overlay (`fps on` / `fps off` / `fps debug`) — a yellow
  screen-space "FPS: N" readout in the upper-left, toggled from the
  console. `fps on` is the stable snapshot (one wall-clock frame
  interval re-sampled every ~200 frames); `fps debug` is a live
  rolling average over the last ~200 frames for perf diagnostics.
  Both modes read **wall-clock** deltas via `Instant::now()` stored
  in `Renderer::last_frame_instant` — measuring render-body time
  there would be a lie under stress, because `render()` early-returns
  on font-system lock contention and would collapse the reported
  frame cost to near zero. The render-side plumbing
  (`Renderer::{fps_display_mode, fps_overlay_buffers,
  set_fps_display, tick_fps}`, `RenderDecree::SetFpsDisplay(FpsDisplayMode)`,
  `rebuild_fps_overlay_if_needed`) compiles on both targets; only
  the `fps` console verb is native-gated because the console itself
  is. Browsers expose FPS via DevTools so the parity gap is
  low-value to close.

**Absent on both targets** (named so they're visible as gaps, not
mistaken for "handled somewhere"):
- Touch gestures (tap / pinch / long-press) — the
  `PlatformContext::Touch` variant exists but no input path dispatches
  on it.
- DPI-aware canvas sizing on WASM — the canvas buffer tracks CSS pixels
  1:1; no `devicePixelRatio` handling.
- `PlatformContext` runtime detection — always the compile-time
  `Desktop` / `Web` branch.

The prescriptive rule that goes with this list — new interactive
features need a cross-platform story from the start — lives in
`CODE_CONVENTIONS.md §4`. `./test.sh`'s WASM type-check gate and
`./build.sh --wasm` are the local checks that keep it honest.

## Common tasks

- **Run tests**: `./test.sh` runs the full suite across both crates,
  prints a test count, then type-checks `wasm32-unknown-unknown` so
  cross-platform drift fails the run. Flags: `--coverage` (runs under
  `cargo-llvm-cov`, outputs `target/llvm-cov/html/index.html`),
  `--lint` (advisory `cargo fmt --check` + `cargo clippy`), `--bench`
  (runs the criterion benches after tests).
- **Build releases**: `./build.sh` cleans prior output and builds both
  the native binary (`target/release/mandala`) and the WASM bundle
  (`dist/` via `trunk build --release`). `--debug` builds dev profile
  on both sides; `--fat` switches native to `release-lto`. Requires
  `trunk` on `PATH` and the `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.
- **Run the app**: `./run.sh [map.mindmap.json]` launches the release
  binary and `trunk serve --release` in parallel; Ctrl+C stops both.
  For one-off iteration use `cargo run -- maps/testament.mindmap.json`
  (native) or `trunk serve` (WASM) directly.
- **Target a specific test**: `cargo test -p baumhard --lib <pattern>` or
  `cargo test -p mandala --lib <pattern>`.
- **Load a different mindmap**: the first positional CLI arg is the path
  to a `.mindmap.json` file; WASM reads it from the `?map=` query param.

## How to work with this codebase

- Prefer editing over creating. New files should feel justified.
- Small, focused changes land smoothly; sprawling refactors rarely do.
- Tasks are sized as session-chunks. If a task feels much bigger than
  its session, that's a signal to split it.
- When you add a user-facing feature, update the **Dual-target status**
  section above so the parity surface stays honest. A cross-platform
  feature adds to "Runs on both targets"; a native-only addition adds
  (with its reason) to "Native-only today" and a path forward.
- Tests are expected to stay green across changes. `./test.sh` runs
  everything including the WASM type-check gate; run it before
  committing.
