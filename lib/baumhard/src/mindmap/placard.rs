//! The map that gets shown when a map could not be loaded.
//!
//! A load failure has to reach the person holding the file, and the
//! only surface guaranteed to exist at that moment is the canvas: on
//! a desktop launch — double-click, `.desktop` entry, file
//! association — there is no terminal attached, so `stderr` is not
//! merely unread, it is gone. The answer here is to hand the shell a
//! *map* rather than a special-cased overlay: a placard is an
//! ordinary one-node [`MindMap`](crate::mindmap::model::MindMap)
//! carrying the loader's own message as
//! its text, so it renders through the same tree projection as any
//! other document (CODE_CONVENTIONS §3 "Render document content
//! through the Baumhard tree") and needs no second pipeline, no
//! renderer pass, and no GPU to test.
//!
//! **A placard is deliberately not the user's map.** It has its own
//! name, and the application binds it to no file path, so a reflexive
//! `Ctrl+S` cannot write it over the file that failed to parse. That
//! property lives at the application boundary — this module only
//! promises that the placard is a valid, self-contained map.
//!
//! ## The message is reproduced whole, and where it stops being whole
//!
//! Truncating a loader message defeats the point: the messages name
//! the offending node id, the offending key and the migration verb,
//! and the tail is where the actionable part usually is — serde puts
//! `at line L column C` last of all. So every message the loader
//! realistically emits reaches the canvas verbatim. The longest of
//! them is the parent-cycle report, which spells the whole chain out:
//! a 400-node cycle is ~3 150 clusters and 56 wrapped lines, well
//! inside the budget below.
//!
//! **A loader message is not bounded, though, and the unbounded part
//! is supplied by the file.** serde's ``invalid type: string
//! "<value>", expected f64`` quotes the offending JSON string back at
//! whatever length it was given: a 4 MB string value in a
//! `.mindmap.json` — or in a `?map=` URL a browser was handed —
//! produces a 4 MB message. Reproduced in full that is 62 508 wrapped
//! lines and a node 1 950 250 canvas units tall, and every part of
//! that is bad. The map stops round-tripping, because
//! [`MAX_NODE_AXIS`](crate::mindmap::model::MAX_NODE_AXIS) is
//! 1 000 000 and `load_from_str` refuses a node above it; the
//! application's grow-to-fit clamp pins the *box* to that ceiling and
//! leaves the *text* at 62 508 lines, so the message this module
//! exists to show is clipped by the box meant to hold it; and nobody
//! reads 62 508 lines regardless. The breach starts at 32 052 wrapped
//! lines, which is ~2 051 300 message bytes at
//! [`PLACARD_COLUMNS`].
//!
//! `MAX_NODE_AXIS` is therefore **not** the backstop this module used
//! to name. It sits downstream of the placard and clamps the wrong
//! quantity. The backstop is here: [`load_failure_text`] elides the
//! *middle* of anything longer than [`PLACARD_HEAD_CLUSTERS`] +
//! [`PLACARD_TAIL_CLUSTERS`], keeping both ends because both carry
//! signal, and those budgets are chosen so the tallest placard they
//! can produce stays under the ceiling by construction rather than by
//! luck.
//!
//! The worst case this module used to name — ``unknown field `x`,
//! expected one of …`` — is not merely no longer the longest, it can
//! no longer occur: #117 removed every `deny_unknown_fields` from the
//! model, so an unknown field is a `warn!` and not a load failure at
//! all.

///
/// The loader is why this is needed at all: exactly one of its
/// failure modes names the file — `load_from_file`'s *read* error,
/// which is what a mistyped path produces — and none of the others
/// do. Asking the message is therefore more honest than classifying
/// the error, and it stays right if a second message ever grows a
/// path.
///
/// **A substring is not a name, and the difference is user-visible.**
/// `mandala map` on a malformed file named `map` produces `Failed to
/// parse mindmap JSON: expected ident at line 1 column 2`, which
/// contains `map` — inside the word *mindmap*. A plain `contains`
/// answered yes, so the placard dropped its source line and the log
/// line dropped its prefix, and neither surface said which file had
/// failed. That is exactly the emptiness this module exists to
/// replace, reached by a shorter path.
///
/// So the occurrence has to be *bounded*: the characters on either
/// side of it must be ones that cannot continue a path. Alphanumerics
/// continue a name (`map` inside `mindmap`), and `_ - . / \ ~`
/// continue a path (`map` inside `map.mindmap.json`, or inside
/// `maps/map` — a different file from `map`, and one the message
/// therefore does not name). Everything else — whitespace, `:`,
/// quotes, the ends of the string — bounds it. A Windows `C:\maps\x`
/// still works: `:` bounds, and the drive letter is inside the source
/// rather than beside it.
///
/// **The residual, stated exactly.** A source whose whole name is a
/// word of the loader's own prose — a file called `mindmap`, `file`,
/// or `JSON` — is still read as named, and its source line is still
/// dropped. No purely textual predicate can do better: at that point
/// the message really does contain the source, bounded, and only
/// knowing that the loader wrote the word rather than interpolated
/// the path would separate them. Erring the other way costs a
/// duplicated path on a screen that already failed; erring this way
/// costs the filename entirely, so the bound is set where the
/// realistic collisions are and the exotic one is written down.
