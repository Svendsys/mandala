//! Per-edge cache of connection glyph geometry.
//!
//! Why it exists: during a drag the scene builder would otherwise
//! re-sample every visible edge every frame, even though most edges
//! have not moved. For a 20,000-unit cross-link at typical spacing
//! that is ~1,667 Bezier point evaluations + a 256-entry arc-length
//! table rebuild per frame per such edge, which is more than enough
//! to blow the drag budget and stutter the interaction.
//!
//! This module lets the scene builder stash the **pre-clip** sampled
//! positions of each edge keyed by `(from_id, to_id, edge_type)`. On the
//! next frame, if neither endpoint of the edge has moved (i.e. neither
//! appears in the drag `offsets` map) the cached samples are reused — the
//! cheap `point_inside_any_node` clip filter still runs against the current
//! frame's `node_aabbs` so a stable edge still clips correctly around a
//! *moved* third node that passes through its path.
//!
//! Invariants:
//!
//! - The cache is always safe to drop. Clearing it just forces a full
//!   re-sample on the next build.
//! - Samples are stored in canvas space. Camera *pan* does not invalidate
//!   the cache. Camera *zoom*, however, DOES change the effective
//!   canvas-space font size (and therefore the sample spacing) via
//!   `GlyphConnectionConfig::effective_font_size_pt`, so zoom changes
//!   force a full re-sample. This is enforced automatically by
//!   `ensure_zoom`, which the scene builder calls on entry — callers
//!   don't need to remember to flush the cache on zoom themselves.
//! - **An entry holds no styling the frame could read back.** What a
//!   connection *looks like* — its body glyph, its cap glyphs, its
//!   font, its size and its color — is resolved from the live model on
//!   every path, so no styling edit can be served stale out of this
//!   module: there is nothing here to serve. What an entry does hold is
//!   the geometry plus the
//!   [`SampleParams`](crate::mindmap::scene_cache::SampleParams) that
//!   geometry was produced under, and both reuse doors —
//!   [`reusable`](crate::mindmap::scene_cache::SceneConnectionCache::reusable)
//!   and
//!   [`reusable_mut`](crate::mindmap::scene_cache::SceneConnectionCache::reusable_mut)
//!   — refuse an entry whose params no longer match the frame's.
//!
//! (Those three links are spelled crate-absolute on purpose. `mod.rs`
//! carries an outer `///` summary on `pub mod scene_cache;`, rustdoc
//! merges it with this header, and a relative link in the merged block
//! resolves against no module — the failure reports no file or line, so
//! it costs more to find than to avoid.)
//! - What the caller still owes is **geometry the params cannot see**,
//!   and only that: an endpoint that moved in the model without
//!   appearing in the drag `offsets` map, an anchor or control-point
//!   edit, and a node resize. Those are `invalidate_edge` or `clear`.
//!   Nothing about *color* is on that list any more — neither a
//!   theme-variable edit nor a direct `edge.color` / `glyph_connection.color`
//!   edit, because the color is resolved from the model on every
//!   frame and never enters the cache. Selection changes need nothing
//!   either, for the same reason.
