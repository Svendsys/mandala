//! Custom mutation carrier — identity + metadata + payload.
//!
//! A `CustomMutation` is a named, reusable bundle the host application
//! dispatches in response to triggers (clicks, hovers, key bindings)
//! or console commands (`mutation apply`). The payload is a
//! [`MutatorNode`](crate::mutator_builder::MutatorNode) AST that the
//! [`crate::mutator_builder`] walker compiles to a
//! `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>` at apply time. Simple mutations bake
//! their `Vec<Mutation>` into the AST via
//! `scope::self_only`, `scope::descendants`, or
//! `scope::self_and_descendants`;
//! size-aware mutations use a `MutatorNode` with runtime holes and a
//! `SectionContext` registered by the host application under the
//! mutation's `id`.
