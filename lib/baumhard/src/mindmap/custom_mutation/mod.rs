//! Custom mutation carrier — identity + metadata + payload.
//!
//! A `CustomMutation` is a named, reusable bundle the host application
//! dispatches in response to triggers (clicks, hovers, key bindings)
//! or console commands (`mutation apply`). The payload is a
//! [`MutatorNode`](crate::mutator_builder::MutatorNode) AST that the
//! [`crate::mutator_builder`] walker compiles to a
//! `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>` at apply time. Simple mutations bake
//! their `Vec<Mutation>` into the AST via
//! `scope::self_only`, `scope::descendants`, or
//! `scope::self_and_descendants`;
//! size-aware mutations use a `MutatorNode` with runtime holes and a
//! `SectionContext` registered by the host application under the
//! mutation's `id`.

// gate that lands the mutation only on sections) does NOT reduce
// the undo-snapshot window: the snapshot still covers every
// node in the `target_scope`-collected set, even though only a
// subset of those nodes' elements actually mutated. This is by
// design — the predicate-filtered fallout is *node-scoped*, not
// *element-scoped*, and rebuilding the model from a whole-node
// clone trivially restores any per-element subset that landed.
// The over-clone is wasteful but never lossy.
//
// The reverse direction is the bug shape `covers_reach` does
// catch: a `MutatorReach::Children` mutator paired with
// `target_scope: SelfOnly` would recurse into descendants the
// snapshot didn't capture, dropping their state on undo.
