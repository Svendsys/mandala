//! Keys a `.mindmap.json` carries that this build's model has no field
//! for — found at load, reported once each, and written back untouched
//! at save.
//!
//! **The problem this solves is forward compatibility across
//! versions.** A map authored by a newer build carries keys an older
//! build does not know. Refusing the load leaves the reader with
//! nothing; ignoring the keys is worse, because the editor resaves the
//! whole model and the next save deletes them. So the load keeps them:
//! every unrecognized key is captured with the route that leads to it,
//! warned about once, carried on
//! [`MindMap`](crate::mindmap::model::MindMap),
//! and spliced back into the serialized document before it reaches
//! disk.
//!
//! **Why the capture is not a per-type `#[serde(flatten)]` catch-all.**
//! A flattened `HashMap<String, Value>` field cannot go on a type that
//! derives `Copy`, `Eq`, or `Hash` — `serde_json::Value` implements
//! none of the three — and the graph reachable from a load is full of
//! such types (`Color`, `OrderedVec2`, `Position`, `Anchor`, `Range`,
//! `GlyphMatrix`, …). A catch-all on only the types that can hold one
//! would preserve keys in some places and silently drop them in
//! others, which is the failure the policy exists to remove. Capturing
//! at the deserializer instead covers **every** type in the graph, and
//! types the source walk cannot even see (anything `build.rs` emits
//! into `$OUT_DIR`), with no per-type opt-in and therefore no drift
//! surface.
//!
//! What holds the mechanism honest is the other direction: a reachable
//! type must not be able to *swallow* a key before the capture sees
//! it. `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` would abort the load, and
//! `#[serde(flatten)]`, `#[serde(untagged)]` and `#[serde(tag = "…")]`
//! would absorb the key without ever reaching
//! `deserialize_ignored_any`. `mindmap::loader`'s
//! `test_no_loadable_type_can_swallow_an_unknown_key` walks the model's
//! own source and fails if any of them appears.
//!
//! # The model's own serialization is the oracle
//!
//! Two of the three hard problems here are solved by the same thing: a
//! **probe**, the `serde_json::Value` the freshly loaded model
//! serializes to. It is taken once per load, and only for a document
//! that carried something unrecognized, so a map this build authored
//! never pays for it.
//!
//! - **Levels the JSON has that serde's ignored-key path does not.**
//!   An externally tagged enum writes `{"Void": {…}}`, and the variant
//!   name never travels through a `MapAccess`, so serde's path is one
//!   step short. Deciding "is this one-member object a variant wrapper
//!   or the thing I am addressing?" from its member count alone is a
//!   guess, and it guesses wrong the moment a payload carries a key
//!   spelled like the variant. The probe answers it without guessing:
//!   **a key the model itself writes at a level cannot be the key
//!   serde ignored there**, so the walk descends past it. See
//!   `expand_route`.
//! - **Containers the saver omits.** `#[serde(skip_serializing_if)]`
//!   means a container that holds its own default is simply absent
//!   from the saved document, and a route through it would die with
//!   nothing to hold on to. Comparing the authored document against
//!   the probe finds those levels at load time, so the save can put
//!   the container back before writing the key into it. See
//!   `Scaffold`.
//! - **Array elements that move.** A route below an array is
//!   positional, and deleting an earlier element silently slides the
//!   route onto a different one. The probe's element fingerprints are
//!   captured alongside the index, so the save re-finds the element it
//!   was actually attached to — and refuses, loudly, when it cannot.
//!   See `IndexAnchor`.

/// - **A key the model does not write, that the author did, is the
///   member.** Either the unrecognized key itself or a field the saver

/// - Otherwise the level is a wrapper, and the probe has to agree on

/// **Below a container the model does not serialize there is no
