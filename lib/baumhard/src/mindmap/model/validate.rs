//! Shared validation for the mindmap model's **numeric domain** —
//! `MindNode` / `MindSection` geometry, and every authored number a
//! `.mindmap.json` can carry into the scene build.
//!
//! Kept in the model crate so application setters, the loader, and
//! `maptool verify` reject the same shapes with the same messages.
//!
//! **Why the domain is checked at all.** A `.mindmap.json` is
//! untrusted input (`format/macros.md` §"Threat model"), and the
//! consumers of these numbers are not defensive: cosmic-text
//! asserts that a line height is non-zero, `f32::clamp` panics when
//! its bounds are inverted, and the border and connection builders
//! size a `String` or a `Vec` from authored geometry. A field that
//! is merely *typed* `f32` therefore reaches an `assert!` or an
//! allocator with whatever the file said — including `NaN`,
//! infinity, zero, and 1e30. None of those are recoverable at the
//! point they land: an allocation failure and a stack-exhaustion
//! abort are not panics, so CODE_CONVENTIONS §9's "degrade the
//! frame, log, keep running" has nothing to degrade.
//!
//! So the domain is enforced **once, at the trust boundary**, and
//! the model behind it carries only numbers the renderer can
//! survive. The loader rejects rather than repairs, matching the
//! posture it already takes for structure (zero sections, parent
//! cycles, the section cap): a map that would crash the editor does
//! not open, and the message names the part to fix.
