//! `.mindmap.json` loader + saver.
//!
//! **The loader never drops what it does not understand, and never
//! refuses a document for carrying it.** A map authored by a newer
//! build has keys this one has no field for. Refusing the load leaves
//! the reader with an empty window; ignoring the keys is worse,
//! because the editor resaves the whole model and the next save
//! deletes them. So the load keeps them: every unrecognized key is
//! captured with the route back to where it sat, warned about once,
//! carried on
//! [`MindMap::unknown_keys`](crate::mindmap::model::MindMap::unknown_keys),
//! and written back untouched at
//! save. See [`crate::mindmap::unknown_keys`] for the mechanism and
//! why it is not a per-type `#[serde(flatten)]` catch-all.
//!
//! What the model owes that mechanism is only that no type between the
//! document root and a key can absorb it first — no
//! `deny_unknown_fields`, no `flatten`, no `untagged` or `tag`. That is
//! enforced against the model that exists, not a list of it, by
//! `tests::test_no_loadable_type_can_swallow_an_unknown_key`.
//!
//! **Three shapes are still refused, and all three are pre-refactor
//! spellings with a migration verb**: a top-level `portals[]`, per-node
//! `text` / `text_runs`, and a `sections` that is not an array. Those
//! are not keys from the future — they are keys from the past that the
//! current model means something else by, so preserving them would
//! carry a contradiction forward. Each gets a concrete `maptool convert
//! ...` pointer.
//!
//! A successful load parses the document exactly once. A map that does
//! carry unknown keys pays one more pass, to lift their values out;
//! everything else expensive lives on the failure path, where the raw
//! JSON is re-examined only to explain a parse that already failed.
