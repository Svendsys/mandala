//! `.mindmap.json` loader + saver.
//!
//! **The loader never drops what it does not understand.** A key the
//! model has no field for is a load error, not a shrug: the editor
//! resaves the map it loaded, so a key ignored at load is a key
//! deleted at save, and the file the author hand-wrote was the only
//! copy. Every type reachable from a load therefore carries
//! `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` — enforced against the model that
//! exists, not a list of it, by
//! `tests::test_every_loadable_type_rejects_unknown_keys`.
//!
//! That posture is what the pre-refactor rejections were always an
//! instance of: a top-level `portals[]` array or per-node `text` /
//! `text_runs` is a shape serde would otherwise ignore, and those get
//! a concrete `maptool convert ...` pointer instead of the generic
//! message.
//!
//! Everything expensive lives on the failure path. A successful load
//! parses the document exactly once; the raw JSON is re-examined only
//! to explain a parse that already failed.
