//! Connection-path geometry: anchor resolution, straight/cubic Bezier
//! path construction, arc-length sampling, and point-to-path distance.
//!
//! - `build_connection_path` turns an edge's anchors + control points
//!   into a `ConnectionPath` (straight or cubic Bezier).
//! - `sample_path` walks evenly-spaced points along a path —
//!   the connection pass uses these to place per-glyph anchors along a
//!   rendered connection.
//! - `distance_to_path` measures a point against a path;
//!   `distance_to_path_within` is the tolerance-bounded form the edge
//!   hit-test uses, which rejects a far-away path from its bounding
//!   box without sampling it.
//!
//! The cubic-Bezier internals (arc-length table, parameter binary
//! search) live in the sibling `bezier` module; the tests live in
//! `tests.rs` so the public surface here stays skimmable.

/// Cubic-Bezier math and arc-length sampling — the internals
/// behind `sample_path` and `distance_to_path`.

/// larger than a click tolerance at high zoom.
///
/// **The term applies to `Straight` paths as well, and there its
/// status is different — say so rather than bank it.**
/// [`path_bounds`] is *exact* for a straight segment (it is the two
/// endpoints), so no hull escape exists there. What remains is
/// [`distance_to_path`]'s straight branch, which reaches its answer
/// through `point_to_segment_distance_squared`: the accept side
/// compares that computed distance against `tolerance` while the
/// reject side compares an exact axis overhang, and the projection
/// `a + ab * t` rounds relative to the coordinate. So the same
/// disagreement is *available* in principle.
///
/// It has not been exhibited. The window is narrow by construction —
/// a correctly-rounded `a + ab * t` cannot put the closest point more
/// than half an ulp of the coordinate outside the box, so a
/// disagreement needs the true distance to sit inside that half-ulp
/// of `tolerance` — and a search aimed straight at it found nothing:
/// 96 000 000 probes over five magnitudes (10³–10⁷), six tolerances
/// from 0.02 to 12, segment orientations swept from near-vertical to
/// near-horizontal, and offsets stepped finely through the tolerance
/// boundary on the escaping face, produced **zero** disagreements
/// against a tolerance-only margin. The straight corpus entries added
/// alongside this note likewise pass with the term removed.
///
/// So this paragraph is an argument, not a measurement, and it is
/// labeled as one on purpose: promoting it to a demonstrated effect
/// would be the same move — a claim outrunning its evidence — that
/// put the defect this constant fixes into the tree. The term covers
/// straight paths because it is cheaper to apply it uniformly than to
/// reason about which branch needs it, and that is the whole of the
/// claim.
///
/// **What 32 is chosen against, and what that does and does not
/// mean.** No closed-form bound on the escape is derived anywhere in
/// this tree, so every figure available is a measured maximum over a
/// finite sweep — a sample, not a ceiling. Successive denser sweeps
/// have each found a larger number than the one before, which is the
/// honest shape of that situation rather than a reason to distrust
/// any of them. The largest figure any sweep has produced is
/// recorded once, in `MEASURED_WORST_ESCAPE_ULPS` beside
/// `test_path_bounds_slack_covers_the_sampler_escape`, together with
/// the methods that produced it; it is deliberately not restated
/// here, because a figure copied into a second place is a figure
/// that goes stale silently. That test asserts in both directions —
/// no sweep may exceed the record, and this constant must stay at
/// least four times above it — so the two cannot drift apart.
///
/// **What the sweeps establish that a number could not** is that the
/// escape is *magnitude-invariant* in these units: the worst per
/// decade varies by well under a factor of two from 10⁰ to 10²⁰.
/// That is the finding this constant actually rests on, because it
/// is what makes `|coordinate|` the right quantity to scale by at
/// all; the particular ulp count only sets where to put the ceiling.
/// The invariance is asserted rather than quoted, in the same test.
///
/// The asymmetry is what makes generous the right side to err on:
