//! Timing envelope, easing curves, and lerp helpers for animated
//! `CustomMutation`s. Any custom mutation with
//! `timing: Some(AnimationTiming { ... })` is started as an
//! animation instance by the app layer instead of applied
//! instantly; each tick evaluates the easing curve and writes a
//! blended snapshot the existing `rebuild_all` path repaints.
//!
//! This module deliberately replaces the dormant
//! [`crate::core::animation`] skeleton. The dormant types are
//! generic over a `Mutable` trait and don't fit Mandala's
//! `MindMap` model + `MutatorTree` shape.
//!
//! # Architecture
//!
//! - `AnimationTiming` is a serializable envelope on
//!   `CustomMutation` carrying `duration_ms`, `delay_ms`, an
//!   `Easing` curve, and an optional `Followup`.
//! - The per-active-mutation runtime record (snapshot of from/to
//!   states, elapsed time, completion path) lives in the app
//!   layer — `mandala::application::document::AnimationInstance`
//!   — because the snapshot type (`MindNode`) and the
//!   completion commit (`apply_custom_mutation`) both live
//!   there. This module stays pure baumhard: serializable types
//!   and stateless helpers, no `MindNode` or document coupling.
//! - `lerp_f32`, `lerp_vec2`, `lerp_color` are the per-field
//!   interpolators. Position, scale, and color fields blend
//!   continuously; structural changes (text replacement, region
//!   count shifts) snap at the boundary.
//!
//! # Composition with the §B2 mutator path
//!
//! Each tick produces a blended snapshot that the app's
//! `rebuild_all` translates into the same tree-walk path drag,
//! edit, and selection share. Animation never writes to the
//! model mid-flight; the model commit happens at the animation
//! boundary via the standard `apply_custom_mutation` path.
//! Drag, edit, and animation all share the "tree-only previews,
//! model-only commits" invariant.
