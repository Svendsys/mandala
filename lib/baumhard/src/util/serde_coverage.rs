//! Reachability walk over the crate's own source, so a test can ask
//! "which types can this deserializer actually be handed?" and get an
//! answer that stays true as the model grows.
//!
//! The problem this exists to solve: a `.mindmap.json` key this build
//! has no field for is captured at load and written back at save
//! (`mindmap::unknown_keys`), and that only works while no type
//! between the document root and the key can absorb it first.
//! `#[serde(deny_unknown_fields)]` aborts the load; `#[serde(flatten)]`
//! swallows the key before `deserialize_ignored_any` is ever reached.
//! Neither produces a compile error, and the two even combine — with
//! `deny` silently winning and the flattened map left empty. A
//! hand-maintained list of "types that must not do that" is exactly
//! the sort of twin surface that drifts the moment somebody adds a
//! field — the same failure mode `lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md` §B4
//! records for the field-tag enums.
//!
//! So nothing is listed. [`TypeGraph::build`] parses every non-test
//! `.rs` file under baumhard's `src/` with `syn`, indexes every
//! struct / enum / type alias, and [`TypeGraph::reachable_from`]
//! walks the field graph outward from a root type name. Adding a
//! field of a new type extends the covered set automatically; the
//! test that consumes this fails until the new type opts in.
//!
//! **`src/` is the whole of what it can see**, and that is a real
//! limit rather than a phrasing detail: a type emitted by
//! `lib/baumhard/build.rs` into `$OUT_DIR` is reachable from a load
//! and invisible here. [`TypeGraph::unresolved_from`] reports every
//! name the walk gave up on so a test can hold that gap to an
//! explicit list instead of letting it grow in silence.
//!
//! Test-only and native-only: it reads `.rs` files off the
//! filesystem, which is also why it is `#[cfg(test)]` — `syn` is a
//! dev-dependency and nothing in a shipped build should carry a
//! parser for its own source.
