//! CODE_CONVENTIONS §9's last sentence, held against the tree
//! instead of written down and trusted: **no shipped line in this
//! workspace calls `unwrap()`.**
//!
//! §9 spends four paragraphs on where a panic is honest — the
//! startup phases that `expect` with a reason, the map load that
//! degrades instead — and closes with "Bare `unwrap()` outside tests
//! is a bug." The difference between an `expect` and an `unwrap` is
//! the sentence a reader gets when it fires, so the rule is about
//! what a failure *says*, not about which of two functions was
//! called. Nothing enforced it: issue #42 counted twenty-six
//! offenders by hand, and by the time anyone looked again six weeks
//! later nine of the twenty-six had been deleted or moved by
//! unrelated work, one had already been fixed, and one was new.
//! That drift is the argument for a scan rather than a list.
//!
//! **What counts as shipped.** Four excisions, and each names a
//! shape of test code the previous one cannot see:
//!
//! 1. `#[cfg(test)]`-gated items, excised in place by
//!    [`crate::util::source_scan::production_source`] so a file's
//!    line numbers survive into the report.
//! 2. Files a `#[cfg(test)] mod x;` declaration names, via
//!    [`test_gated_module_files`] — the gate is in the *declaring*
//!    file and nothing in the declared one says so.
//! 3. Files that gate themselves with `#![cfg(test)]`, handled
//!    inside `production_source` for the same reason.
//! 4. Baumhard's `pub mod tests;` trees and `benches/`, which carry
//!    **no** gate at all: §T2.2 makes them `pub` on purpose so the
//!    criterion harness can import the bodies, which means they
//!    really do compile into a shipped library. They are excluded by
//!    path, and that is the one exclusion here resting on a
//!    convention rather than on an attribute.
//!
//! **`unwrap` is read as a call, not as a word.** Comments come off
//! and string literals are blanked before the scan, because this
//! module's own prose says `unwrap()` more often than the workspace's
//! code ever did, and `startup_load.rs` ships a `PANICKING` constant
//! whose *contents* are the string `".unwrap()"`. Both would
//! otherwise be offenders.
//!
//! Test-only and native-only, for the same reasons
//! [`crate::util::source_scan`] is.
