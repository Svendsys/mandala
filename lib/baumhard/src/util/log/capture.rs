//! Scoped capture of the `warn!` / `error!` records one stretch of
//! code emits on the current thread, so a caller can hand them to
//! someone who cannot read the process's stderr.
//!
//! CODE_CONVENTIONS §9 makes `warn!` the visible half of "degrade,
//! log, keep running". That half reaches whoever reads the log, and
//! for a request that arrived over a socket, that is the wrong
//! person. The IPC reply envelope carries a `warnings` array for
//! that reason (`format/ipc.md` §Warnings). Filling it by threading a
//! sink through every dispatch arm, document setter and Baumhard
//! primitive a command can reach would be a second diagnostic
//! channel beside the first, and it would be incomplete the day it
//! was written. So the existing channel is tapped instead: every
//! record the installed logger receives also passes through
//! `observe`, and a [`capture`] window open on that thread keeps
//! it. A `warn!` added anywhere later is captured with no further
//! work. Each record is logged once and reported once, with the same
//! text.
//!
//! **A stable code travels with the record.** A log site that wants
//! a machine-branchable identity attaches it as the `code` key-value
//! (`log::warn!(code = SOME_CODE; "area: …")`, the [`CODE_KEY`]
//! key). The capture reads it from the record. Every other record
//! arrives with `code: None` and is classified by the consumer.
//!
//! **What feeds it.** Only records that reach the installed logger:
//! [`crate::util::log::init`]'s logger in a binary — on native the
//! `env_logger` wrapper, in the browser the console wrapper, both of
//! which offer every record here before their own filter — and
//! [`crate::util::test_logger`] in a test binary. With no logger
//! installed, `log`'s global max level stays `Off`, nothing reaches
//! `observe`, and a capture comes back empty. A test asserting on
//! captured records therefore calls `test_logger::install()` first.
//!
//! Both targets': its consumer, the IPC command executor, runs on
//! both (`format/ipc.md` §Transport "Browser"). The window is a
//! thread-local, which on `wasm32-unknown-unknown` is the one main
//! thread's.
