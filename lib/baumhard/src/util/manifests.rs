//! Reader over the workspace's own `Cargo.toml` files, so a test can
//! ask "is any dependency's version written down in more than one
//! place?" and get an answer that stays true as members are added.
//!
//! The problem this exists to solve: nothing in cargo objects when
//! two members of a workspace name the same crate at two different
//! versions. It resolves both, builds both, and the only symptom is
//! a slower build and two incompatible copies of the same types.
//! That is not hypothetical here — `strum` sat at 0.27 in the app
//! crate and 0.28 in baumhard, compiling two runtime crates and two
//! proc-macro crates, until it was unified by hand. The structural
//! fix is `[workspace.dependencies]`, and the reason to test it is
//! that the fix is only as good as the next person's remembering to
//! use it: adding `strum = "0.29"` to one member re-creates the
//! split in one line.
//!
//! So the rule from the root manifest's comment is checked here
//! rather than trusted:
//!
//! - a dependency two or more members need is declared once, in
//!   `[workspace.dependencies]`, and members write
//!   `dep.workspace = true`;
//! - a dependency in that table is not given a version by any member
//!   (which would silently override it);
//! - the table carries nothing only one member uses.
//!
//! What the first two clauses do *not* reach: a declaration with no
//! version string. `path` dependencies have none by construction, and
//! neither do `git` ones — two members could pin one crate to two
//! different revisions and nothing here would report it. No member
//! uses a `git` dependency today; the day one arrives, this is where
//! that gap gets closed rather than discovered.
//!
//! **The member list is read, not restated.** [`member_manifests`]
//! parses `[workspace] members` out of the root manifest, so a fifth
//! crate is covered the day it is added — the failure mode
//! `test.sh`'s hand-written `-p` list demonstrated for as long as
//! `mandala_derive` existed.
//!
//! Test-only and native-only: it reads files off the filesystem, and
//! nothing in a shipped build has any business parsing manifests.
//!
//! ## On the parser
//!
//! It is line-oriented, not a TOML implementation, and the shape of
//! its ignorance is the whole design. A parser that quietly matched
//! nothing would turn every test below into a test that cannot fail,
//! so the rule is: **a legal shape either parses or stops the run —
//! it never deletes itself from the checked set.**
//!
//! Concretely:
//!
//! - Every spelling in use here parses; the rest stop the run. The
//!   inline `serde = { version = "1", features = [...] }`, the
//!   sub-table header `[dependencies.serde]` with its keys on the
//!   lines below, and the dotted `serde.workspace = true`. The
//!   sub-table form is what a `taplo fmt` or a long feature list
//!   turns the inline one into, and it is a one-line way to re-split
//!   a version, so it has to be seen rather than skipped. Cargo
//!   accepts one more spelling nobody here writes — the rest of the
//!   dotted family, `serde.version = "1"` and `serde.path = "../x"`,
//!   which is the sub-table written inline. That one refuses by name
//!   rather than parsing, which is the safe direction: it stops a run
//!   instead of deleting a declaration from the checked set.
//! - A leading UTF-8 BOM is stripped before anything is read. Cargo
//!   accepts a BOM, so a manifest carrying one is a manifest this
//!   reader has to see all of; left in place it hides the first
//!   section header, and every key under that header with it.
//! - A renamed dependency (`fast = { package = "rustc-hash", ... }`)
//!   is recorded under the crate it actually pulls in, so a rename
//!   cannot hide a split behind a different key.
//! - A trailing `# comment` on a declaration is stripped, quotes
//!   respected. Manifests in this workspace are heavily commented;
//!   adding one more comment must not be able to fail a test.
//! - A declaration wrapped across lines — a long `features` list, or
//!   whatever a formatter does to the 190-column `web-sys` entry — is
//!   rejoined before it is read. A line break cannot change which
//!   crate is pulled in at which version, so it may not change the
//!   answer given here.
//! - Everything left **refuses**: a section header the reader has no
//!   classification for, a table nested deeper under a dependency
//!   table, a header whose `]` never arrives, a value that is neither
//!   a version string nor an inline table. Each panics naming the
//!   file, the line, and what the reader could not do with it.
//!
//! The refusal policy is weighted by risk on purpose, because it used
//! to be weighted the other way: silence is for shapes that cannot
//! change an answer, and noise is for anything that could be a
//! dependency the rules never see.
//!
//! [`tests`] pins all of this against synthetic manifests — including
//! ones that *must* be rejected, and shapes the real manifests do not
//! yet use — before pointing the parser at the real ones. A fixture
//! made only of shapes the manifests already contain could never
//! discover a shape they could grow.
