//! What the **derive macro** says the on-disk shape is, asked of the
//! generated code rather than of the source text that produced it.
//!
//! [`crate::util::serde_coverage`] answers the same questions by
//! parsing baumhard's own `.rs` files with `syn`. That walk is the
//! only thing `format/schema.md`'s published array list rests on, and
//! a walk is a *reading* of the source — it can be wrong in ways the
//! document it feeds is then wrong in too. The two agree because they
//! share a derivation, not because the derivation is right, and
//! [issue #122](https://github.com/Svendsys/mandala/issues/122) is the
//! record of that: a `Vec` behind a type alias, a `VecDeque`, a
//! `#[serde(rename(deserialize = "…"))]`, a container `rename_all` —
//! each one produces a wrong published name or a missing array, and
//! nothing disagrees.
//!
//! So something has to disagree, and it has to get its answer from
//! somewhere else. `serde_derive` already wrote the truth down: the
//! `Deserialize` impl it generates for a struct calls
//! `Deserializer::deserialize_struct(name, FIELDS, visitor)` where
//! `FIELDS` is the exact list of JSON member names — every `rename`
//! spelling resolved, `rename_all` applied, the identifier used only
//! where nothing overrode it. An enum's impl names its variants the
//! same way. A `Vec` field asks for [`Deserializer::deserialize_seq`]
//! whatever it is spelled or aliased as, and a tuple asks for
//! [`Deserializer::deserialize_tuple`], which is the distinction
//! between "an index an edit can move" and "a position the format
//! fixes".
//!
//! [`derived_shape`] hands the derived impls a `Deserializer` that
//! answers every request with the emptiest value that satisfies it and
//! writes down what was asked. Nothing is parsed, nothing is listed,
//! and no `.mindmap.json` is involved: the walk is the compiler's own
//! expansion of the model, driven from `MindMap::deserialize` outward.
//!
//! `#[serde(alias = "…")]` is in that truth too, and reading it the
//! other way round was the module's first real defect. The derive
//! puts a field's aliases into the same `FIELDS` list as its name and
//! a variant's into `VARIANTS`, grouped with the name they alias and
//! sorted inside the group — so the probe sees every spelling, and
//! the published list carries all of them. What the list does *not*
//! say is where one field's group ends, and offering it blindly hands
//! the derived visitor the same field twice, which it refuses. That
//! refusal is where a group boundary gets learned; see
//! [`fold_a_rejected_spelling`].
//!
//! **It is not a replacement for the source walk and must not become
//! one.** It cannot see a type no value reaches (a serialize-only
//! proxy), and it says nothing about `deny_unknown_fields`. Three
//! shapes stop it outright rather than being seen: a
//! `#[serde(flatten)]` field, an internally or adjacently tagged
//! enum, and a `deserialize_with` that validates what it is handed.
//! One more is worse than any of those, and it is the only one that
//! is not loud: **`#[serde(untagged)]`**, which decides its variant
//! by replaying a buffered `Content` and so quietly matches whichever
//! variant accepts the probe's unit, losing every other variant's
//! shape without an error. That is why [`DerivedShape::opaque_sites`]
//! exists — the silence is reported as a place rather than left as an
//! absence. What the module is good for is exactly one thing: being a
//! **second, independent** answer to "which JSON members hold
//! growable arrays of key-bearing values", so
//! `mindmap::unknown_keys::tests::test_the_derived_positional_arrays_survive_an_independent_derivation`
//! has something that can disagree.
//!
//! Test-only: nothing in a shipped build deserializes a model type
//! from a probe. Unlike its counterpart it reads no files and pulls in
//! no `syn`, so nothing about it is native-only — and it carries the
//! same `not(target_arch = "wasm32")` gate regardless, because every
//! consumer of it does. A module compiled into a build where nothing
//! calls it is a pile of dead-code warnings claiming a portability
//! that no gate exercises.
