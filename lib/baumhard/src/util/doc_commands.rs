//! The `cargo` commands this repository writes down, held against the
//! workspace they claim to drive.
//!
//! A command written into a doc is a claim — *run this and it does
//! what the sentence around it says* — and nothing here checked
//! those claims. Two had been false since they were written, and
//! #148 found both.
//!
//! `CLAUDE.md`'s "Common tasks" and `TEST_CONVENTIONS.md` §T11 both
//! told a reader to narrow a mandala test run with `-p mandala`
//! plus `--lib`, which exits 101 with `no library targets found in
//! package 'mandala'` — that member is a binary crate. The flag is
//! correct on its neighbor, since baumhard *is* a library, and had
//! been copied across.
//!
//! The other was quieter and cost more. Five documents, `CLAUDE.md`
//! §7 and `AGENTS.md` among them, published a `--benches` check as
//! the proof that a bench target still compiles — the only proof an
//! agent is allowed, since running the benchmarks is forbidden — and
//! wrote it with no package selection. Cargo then takes the root
//! package alone, which declares `autobenches = false` and owns no
//! bench target, so it compiles nothing, prints "Finished" and exits
//! 0 over a bench file full of type errors. A gate that cannot fail
//! reads exactly like a gate that passes.
//!
//! Both defects are mechanical, so both are checked mechanically
//! against the real manifests:
//!
//! - every `-p <name>` in an audited section names a workspace
//!   member;
//! - every `--lib` sits on a member that actually has a library
//!   target;
//! - every `--benches` sits on a selection that owns a bench target.
//!
//! **The third question is asked repository-wide** — every Markdown
//! file, every Rust comment, and the shell scripts — while the first
//! two are asked of two named sections. The difference is not an
//! oversight in either direction. A `--lib` is a mistake *inside* a
//! passage about narrowing a test run, and [`AUDITED_SECTIONS`] is
//! where those passages live; a `--benches` with no selection is a
//! no-op wherever it is written, including in `test.sh`, which is
//! where it is actually run rather than merely described.
//!
//! **What this reads.** Every way those two sections can publish a
//! command: an inline code span opened with any number of backticks,
//! and every line of a fenced block, whether or not the fence
//! carries a language tag. The tagged fence is called out because it
//! was the one gap that made the reader *inconsistent* rather than
//! narrow — the tag glued itself to the front of the command and the
//! `cargo` filter then dropped it, so a fence opened with a `bash`
//! tag hid a command that the same fence untagged did not.
//!
//! **What this does not reach**, said plainly so the silence is not
//! read as coverage. It runs nothing: that a documented command is
//! well-formed against the manifests is a weaker claim than that it
//! succeeds, and the strong one belongs to a person at a terminal.
//! It judges only spans carrying an explicit `-p` / `--package`,
//! because a command without one selects whatever package the
//! working directory holds and a code span does not carry a working
//! directory. It reads a command that is *marked up* as one: a
//! `cargo` invocation typed into running prose with no backticks
//! around it is prose to this reader, as is one hidden inside a
//! quoted string. Inside a fence it takes one line as one command,
//! so a shell continuation (`\` at end of line) reads as two. And
//! it reads two named sections rather than every Markdown file, for
//! the reason [`crate::util::doc_fixtures`] exists at all: a
//! whole-file scan stays green after the thing it claims to pin has
//! moved somewhere else entirely.
//!
//! The repository-wide half has its own edges. It reads text rather
//! than markup, so a command in running prose is judged too — but
//! only where the tokens in front of the flag *are* an invocation:
//! `cargo`, a subcommand, then nothing but flags and their values. A
//! `--benches` in a sentence about the flag is prose, not a command,
//! and is passed over. That is a deliberate hole with a floor under
//! it: `assert_bench_scan_is_looking` requires the invocation to
//! still be found in both documents that state the rule and in the
//! script that runs it, so the shape cannot quietly empty out.
//!
//! In a Rust file it reads the comments — `//`, `///`, `//!` and
//! `/* … */` alike, by way of
//! [`comment_text`](crate::util::rust_source::comment_text) — and
//! nothing else, so a string literal holding the bare command is not
//! a claim about how to build this repository. That reader is the
//! whole of the exemption: a hand-rolled one that blanked literals
//! in source that still had its comments would let an unbalanced
//! `"` in prose hide the invocation underneath it.
//!
//! One edge remains, and it is in the loud direction: the reader
//! judges a command by what it says, not by where it would run, so
//! an invocation that a preceding `cd` into a member's directory
//! would make correct is reported anyway. No such shape is written
//! here, and reporting one that is fine costs a sentence in a
//! message, while passing one that is not costs the rule — the
//! direction a checker of something nobody may test by running it
//! has to fail in.
//!
//! Test-only and native-only, for the same reasons
//! `crate::util::manifests` — whose member list this reuses rather
//! than restating — is.
