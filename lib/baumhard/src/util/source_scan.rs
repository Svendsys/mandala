//! Readers over the workspace's **own source text**, for the tests
//! whose subject is the repository rather than a value a function
//! returned.
//!
//! Three such tests exist, and each of them used to carry its own
//! answer to the same question — *which of these bytes are shipped
//! code?*
//!
//! - `mindmap::loader::tests::test_every_mindmap_write_goes_through_the_contract`
//!   asks whether any path outside `loader::to_json_value` turns a
//!   `MindMap` into bytes.
//! - [`crate::util::serde_coverage::TypeGraph`] asks which types a
//!   deserializer can be handed.
//! - [`tests::test_no_doc_cites_a_test_that_does_not_exist`] asks
//!   whether every `test_*` name a comment or a spec writes down is
//!   one the sources declare.
//!
//! Three answers meant three chances to be wrong, and two of them
//! were. The loader's split the file at the first `#[cfg(test)]` and
//! kept the text before it, on the premise that a test module hangs
//! off the *end* of a file. A `mod.rs` declares
//! `#[cfg(test)] mod tests;` among its module *list* instead, so
//! everything the file goes on to say is below the gate:
//! `src/application/document/mod.rs` was read to line 35 of 757, and
//! a raw `serde_json::to_string_pretty(&map)` planted at line 79
//! passed the guard that exists to forbid exactly that. The type
//! graph consulted a `cfg` reader for inline `mod x { … }` and
//! nothing at all for the out-of-line `mod x;` form, so eleven
//! test-only types sat in an index that promises to hold none.
//!
//! So the question is answered once, here. [`is_test_gated`] is the
//! only reader of a `cfg` predicate in the crate;
//! [`production_source`] is the only excision of test code from a
//! file's text; [`test_gated_module_files`] is the only resolution of
//! a test-gated `mod x;` to the files it names.
//!
//! **Both excisions fail toward noise.** [`production_source`] does
//! not descend into function bodies, so a `#[cfg(test)] mod` written
//! inside an `fn` stays in the text a caller scans; the consequence is
//! a false positive a reader adjudicates, never a shipped path that
//! goes unlooked-at. A shape the readers here cannot make sense of —
//! a `#[path = "…"]` module, a file a `mod` names that is not on
//! disk — stops the run by name rather than dropping out of the
//! checked set, which is the discipline [`crate::util::manifests`]
//! records for the manifest parser and for the same reason.
//!
//! Test-only and native-only: it reads `.rs` and `.md` files off the
//! filesystem and leans on `syn`, a dev-dependency.
