//! A real `log::Log` sink, so a test can assert that a degrade path
//! actually said something.
//!
//! CODE_CONVENTIONS §9 makes `warn!` the visible half of "degrade,
//! log, keep running", which means the log line is part of the
//! behavior rather than decoration — and until this existed nothing
//! could tell a `warn!` that fires from one that was deleted. The
//! loader's unknown-key report is the case that forced it: the keys
//! it preserves are observable through
//! [`MindMap::unknown_keys`](crate::mindmap::model::MindMap::unknown_keys),
//! but "and it told somebody" was untestable, and a mutation deleting
//! the `warn!` left the whole suite green.
//!
//! **This is not a mock** (TEST_CONVENTIONS §T10). It is an ordinary
//! implementation of the `log` crate's own trait, installed the way
//! `env_logger` is installed and receiving exactly what a real run
//! would send it. Nothing about the code under test changes shape to
//! accommodate it.
//!
//! **How it survives parallel tests.** `log::set_logger` is
//! process-global and `cargo test` runs tests concurrently, so the
//! buffer holds lines from whatever else happened to be logging.
//! Rather than serialize the suite behind a lock — which would be a
//! standing tax on every future test — callers search the buffer for
//! a needle they made unique, and simply do not care what else is in
//! it. [`lines_containing`] is that search.
//!
//! **What it costs, and the two bounds on it.** Being process-global
//! means every record from every test in the binary is formatted and
//! retained, and the search is linear in what has accumulated. Two
//! things keep that finite: only `warn!` and above are recorded
//! ([`RECORDED_LEVEL`]), and the buffer stops at [`CAPACITY`] rather
//! than growing or forgetting. Both failure modes this could have —
//! a logger conflict at install time and a full buffer at search time
//! — panic with what actually went wrong, because either one
//! otherwise turns into "the code under test did not warn", which is
//! a wrong answer pointing at innocent code.
//!
//! Native-only, like the rest of `#[cfg(test)]` support here: the
//! browser build installs `console_log` and has no use for a buffer.
