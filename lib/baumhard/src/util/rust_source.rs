//! Read this workspace's own Rust source for tests that pin a
//! *source-level* property — one no runtime assertion can see.
//!
//! Two properties are like that in practice, and both are load-bearing:
//! a statement whose only observable effect goes to a process-global
//! logger the suite does not install, and a branch that only compiles
//! on `wasm32` and so is never linked into `cargo test`
//! (`TEST_CONVENTIONS.md` §T9). A test for either has to read the
//! file.
//!
//! ## Why a module instead of `read_to_string` at the call site
//!
//! A naive `source.contains(needle)` is satisfied by **any** byte run
//! in the file, and the two cheapest places for one to hide are the
//! two a person deleting code actually writes:
//!
//! - **A comment.** Gutting a function and leaving
//!   `// this used to be log::error!("startup: {}", message);` keeps
//!   the scan green while the behavior is gone. That is not a
//!   contrived mutation — it is the ordinary shape of a removal.
//! - **The test's own body, or a later test module.** The needle a
//!   test asserts on is spelled out inside that test, so a whole-file
//!   scan of the file the test lives in matches itself. Appending a
//!   test module to a *different* file does the same to a scan of
//!   that file. This is the one a reviewer got past: the recognizer
//!   wanted `mod` as the immediate next token, so this workspace's
//!   own `#[cfg(test)] #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))] mod tests
//!   {` idiom — seven live occurrences — was handed back as
//!   production code, and a two-line shim underneath it revived a
//!   mutation four pins had killed. What the recognizer accepts is
//!   spelled out on
//!   [`above_test_modules`](crate::util::rust_source::above_test_modules),
//!   and held against every shape *in this tree* — not against
//!   invented ones — by the sweep in `util::tests::rust_source_tests`.
//!
//! [`production_code`](crate::util::rust_source::production_code)
//! closes both: it replaces every comment with a space
//! ([`strip_comments`](crate::util::rust_source::strip_comments)) and
//! drops everything from the first test module onward
//! ([`above_test_modules`](crate::util::rust_source::above_test_modules)),
//! so what comes back is the code that ships.
//! [`braced_block_after`](crate::util::rust_source::braced_block_after)
//! narrows further, to one item's body, for the pins that are about
//! one statement.
//!
//! ## What is still out of reach
//!
//! A **string literal** in production code holding the needle
//! verbatim satisfies the scan, because
//! [`strip_comments`](crate::util::rust_source::strip_comments)
//! leaves literals alone — it has to, since the needles here contain
//! string literals themselves
//! (`log::error!("startup: {}", message)`). That is the residual,
//! and it is a deliberate act rather than the ordinary shape of a
//! mistake: scoping a pin to one function body with
//! [`braced_block_after`](crate::util::rust_source::braced_block_after)
//! means hiding a needle requires planting a raw string inside the
//! very function under test.
//!
//! Native-only in effect — it reads files off the filesystem, and
//! nothing in a shipped build parses its own source. It is not
//! `#[cfg(test)]`-gated for the same reason
//! [`crate::util::doc_fixtures`] is not: the callers live in the
//! `mandala` crate, and a `cfg(test)` item in `baumhard` is invisible
//! to them.
//!
//! No criterion entry for
//! [`production_code`](crate::util::rust_source::production_code), on
//! the same precedent as [`crate::util::doc_fixtures`]: it is file
//! I/O on a cold test path, and a benchmark of it would measure the
//! page cache — and none for the tree-wide sweep in
//! `util::tests::rust_source_tests`, which is several hundred of
//! them. The five pure scanners do carry bench entries
//! (`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md` §B7):
//! [`strip_comments`](crate::util::rust_source::strip_comments),
//! [`above_test_modules`](crate::util::rust_source::above_test_modules),
//! [`braced_block_after`](crate::util::rust_source::braced_block_after),
//! [`string_literals`](crate::util::rust_source::string_literals)
//! and
//! [`statements`](crate::util::rust_source::statements).

/// #[cfg(not(target_arch = "wasm32"))] mod tests {` is the house
/// idiom for a test module that cannot build for the browser, with
/// seven live occurrences, all under `src/application/app/` — the

/// mod tests_shim { const SHIM: &str = "…the needle…"; }
/// ```
///
/// to any scanned file satisfied every pin built on this reader while
/// the code it pinned was gutted. One attribute line was the whole
/// difference between that and a red suite.
///
/// ## Why the `{` is load-bearing
///
/// Only an inline module hides text inside *this* file, and it is the
/// only shape that truncates. The two near-misses each cost a real
/// pin before they were handled:
///
/// - **`#[cfg(test)] use …`, or any smaller item.**
///   `src/application/renderer/mod.rs` opens with a test-only import
///   five hundred lines above the code a pin cares about.
/// - **`#[cfg(test)] mod tests_nodes;` — an *external* module.**
///   `src/application/document/mod.rs` declares fourteen of them
///   before its first real item. None of their text is in this file,
///   so there is nothing here to exclude.
///
/// Truncating at either returns a shorter string — in both those
/// cases an empty one — and an empty string satisfies every negative
/// assertion and no positive one: a scan that silently cannot fail is
/// worse than no scan.
///
/// So the anchor is `mod name {`, with the brace. A visibility in
/// front of it is accepted, since a benchmark-reusable test tree is
/// declared `pub mod tests;` (`lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md` §B8).
///
/// ## The one thing that does truncate to (almost) nothing
///
/// `#![cfg(test)]` — the *inner* form, written at the top of a file
/// that is nothing but tests. `src/application/macros/tests.rs` and
/// `src/application/app/dispatch/cross_dispatch/selection/tests.rs`
/// each open with it, and each is declared by a bare `mod tests;`
/// with no attribute on it, so the gate lives nowhere else.
///
/// Cutting there really does leave nothing, and that is the honest
/// answer rather than the dangerous one: the file ships no code, so
/// reporting its test bodies as production code is the same hole the
/// rest of this function closes. It does mean a *negative* assertion
/// over such a file passes vacuously, so a caller that scans a file
/// it did not choose keeps the non-vacuity guard
/// `test_the_placard_is_not_announced_as_a_loaded_map` uses — assert
/// something you expect to find, first.
///
/// **What this deliberately does not remove:** a test `cfg` on a
/// smaller item. Those are code that exists rather than prose that
/// does not, so a needle inside one is a needle in a real function,
/// and the narrower pins built on [`braced_block_after`] do not reach
/// them anyway.
///
/// `code` should already be comment-free; a mention of the attribute
/// in prose would otherwise truncate a file at its own module docs.
