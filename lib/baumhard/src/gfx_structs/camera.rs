/// Variants are *intent*, not raw field writes:
/// - `Pan` shifts the canvas-center by a screen-pixel delta,
///   accounting for current zoom (mouse-drag pan).
/// - `ZoomAt` scales by `factor` while pinning `screen_focus`
///   (cursor-anchored wheel zoom).
/// - `ZoomCenter` scales by `factor` around the viewport
///   center (keyboard zoom, fit-to-bounds tween).
/// - `SetPosition` / `SetZoom` are idempotent assignments,
///   used by fit-to-bounds and animation snapshots.
///
/// Variants compose: an animation timeline emits one
/// `CameraMutation` per tick, and the receiver applies it
/// without caring whether it came from input, a tween, or a
/// scripted gesture.
