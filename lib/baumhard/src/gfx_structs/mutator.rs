//! `GfxMutator` — the top-level mutator variant that rides one node
//! of a `MutatorTree<GfxMutator>`. The four variants cover single-
//! target mutations (`Single`), padded alignment slots (`Void`),
//! control-flow loops (`Instruction` + its
//! [`Predicate`](crate::gfx_structs::predicate::Predicate) condition),
//! and batched field updates against one target (`Macro`). This
//! module also defines the `Mutation` payload enum that `Single`
//! and `Macro` carry, the `Instruction` control-flow enum that
//! `Instruction` nodes carry, and the `GlyphTreeEvent` /
//! `GlyphTreeEventInstance` types that the walker threads through
//! the tree as a side channel during `apply_to`.
