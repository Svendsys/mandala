//! `ZoomVisibility` — an optional lower/upper bound on the camera
//! zoom level at which a [`crate::gfx_structs::area::GlyphArea`] is
//! allowed to render. Orthogonal to the per-element font-size clamps
//! on connections / portals (which reshape *size* with zoom); this
//! primitive controls *presence* — is the element drawn at all at
//! the current zoom?
//!
//! Default is unbounded (both bounds `None`) — any existing
//! `GlyphArea` with no opinion keeps its historical always-visible
//! behaviour. When either bound is `Some`, the renderer's final
//! cull pass skips the element whenever `camera.zoom` falls outside
//! `[min, max]` (inclusive). This is the layering primitive that
//! lets map authors build Google-Maps-style zoom-dependent detail:
//! "only show this label when zoomed in past 1.5×", "only show this
//! landmark when zoomed out below 0.5×".
//!
//! The primitive lives at the Baumhard level so every downstream
//! target — nodes, edges, labels, portals, borders — gets the same
//! cull without each builder re-implementing a parallel check (per
//! `CODE_CONVENTIONS.md` §3 "everything is glyphs" — one filter at
//! the shared seam).
