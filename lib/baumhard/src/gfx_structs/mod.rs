//! Render-side graph structures — the `GfxElement` tree, its

//! the `Scene` that composes multiple trees into one frame. Mindmap
//! nodes, borders, connections, and overlay UI all compile down to
//! `GfxElement`s living in one of these trees; mutations flow through
//! the walker to reshape them without rebuilding from scratch. The
//! `camera`, `scene`, and `tree_walker` modules sit at the top of this
//! stack; `element`, `model`, and `area` own the data each node holds;
//! `util` provides the spatial indexing and hit-test primitives the
