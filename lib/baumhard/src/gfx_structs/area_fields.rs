/// Per-glyph halo style. When set on a [`crate::gfx_structs::area::GlyphArea`], the renderer
/// emits 8 extra shaped buffers behind the area's text — each at the
/// same metrics, family pinning, and alignment, but recolored to
/// `color` and positioned at the offsets yielded by
/// [`OutlineStyle::offsets`]. Used to keep colored glyphs legible
/// against arbitrary (or transparent) backgrounds where a per-pass
/// background fill is not on the table.
///
/// # Technique
///
/// We stamp the glyph 8 times — 4 cardinals at `(±px, 0)` / `(0, ±px)`
/// and 4 diagonals at `(±px/√2, ±px/√2)` — then draw the main glyph
/// on top. Every stamp sits on a circle of radius `px`, and adjacent
/// stamp centers are `~0.77·px` apart. Because each stamp is an
/// entire glyph, the stamps visually merge into a continuous outline
/// as long as `px` is no larger than the glyph's stroke width; a
/// halo wider than a stroke starts reading as ghost letter copies
/// rather than a border.
///
/// # Costs
///
/// Each outlined area costs 9 cosmic-text buffer shapings instead of
/// 1. The stamp count is canonical (chosen inside this crate, not a
/// caller knob) so every consumer gets the same outline quality
/// without having to tune it. Hot-path work (§B7) — enable only when
/// the background legibility problem actually needs it.
