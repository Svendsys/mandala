/// so did swapping the two macros.
///
/// The closure everyone reaches for first is a test logger, and
/// `util::test_logger` really is on an unmerged branch (#117). It is
/// not the only one. `syn` is already a baumhard dev-dependency for
/// exactly this class of question — `util::serde_coverage` parses the
/// crate's own sources so a contract can be *derived* from the code
/// instead of restated beside it — and which `log::` macro sits in
/// which arm is a fact about source text. So this module reads it out
/// of the source.
///
/// **Deriving from the source is not the same as being right**, and
/// the precedent cited above has since been caught at it: issue #122
/// found `serde_coverage` publishing a list `format/schema.md`
/// carried verbatim, both of them wrong in the same three places
/// because the document was written by reading the walk. The lesson
/// that transfers is the one this module already applies in its own
/// way — a source reader has to be a **whitelist that refuses what it
/// does not model**, never a search that reports what it happens to
/// find, because a search's silence is indistinguishable from
/// approval. `check_routing` below is that whitelist;
/// `util::serde_probe` is the same discipline reached by a different
/// road, a second derivation that can disagree.
///
/// **What changed in round 3, and why it is not three more cases.**
/// The first version of this module *searched* for `log::` calls: it
/// walked the body looking for `if`s, remembered the method name of
/// each condition, and reported the pairs it happened to find. A
/// search over a language model that covers four of Rust's roughly
/// forty expression forms passes vacuously for the other thirty-six.
/// Three spellings proved it: an outer `if` wrapped around the whole
/// reporting block made `from_style_string` log nothing at all and
/// left the pin green; `#[cfg(any())]` on the `warn!` deleted it from
/// every build and left the pin green; a second `warn!` added inside
/// a `for` loop restored issue #118 verbatim and left the pin green.
/// Patching in three more cases would have left the thirty-third.
///
/// So the decision moved out of the source and into a value —
/// [`ShapeSpelling::report`](crate::gfx_structs::shape::ShapeSpelling::report)
/// returns a
/// [`ShapeReport`](crate::gfx_structs::shape::ShapeReport), which
/// `do_shape_report_routes_every_classification` tests as ordinary
/// data — and what is left here is a **whitelist** over what remains:
/// [`check_routing`] states the exact shape the body is allowed to
/// have and returns `Err` for everything else. Three statements, no
/// more and no fewer; each one pinned to the expression it must be;
/// one `match` arm per `ShapeReport` variant plus one `None` arm;
/// each reporting arm a bare `log::<macro>!` whose name is derived
/// from `ShapeReport::level()` rather than restated; and no attribute
/// anywhere in the body but a doc comment. An unmodeled construct
/// fails by not matching, which is the property a search cannot have.
///
/// **Round 4 gave the *selection* the same treatment.** Whitelisting
/// a body is worth nothing if the pin then searches for which body to
/// read: [`from_style_string_fn`] used to take the first
/// `impl NodeShape` that happened to define the name, so a decoy
/// above the real definition — a `#[cfg(any())]` impl, a
/// `#[cfg(target_arch)]` pair, or an ordinary
/// `impl SomeTrait for NodeShape` needing no conditional compilation
/// at all — was what the pin reported on while the real definition
/// went back to warning per node. [`select_from_style_string`] is the
/// requirement that replaced it: every `from_style_string` under a
/// `NodeShape` impl is a candidate, there must be exactly one, its
/// enclosing block must carry no attribute but a doc comment, and
/// that block must be the inherent impl.
///
/// **What it still cannot see**, stated plainly because the round-2
/// disclosure was not:
///
/// - **Anything outside `from_style_string`.** A `log::warn!` added
///   to `ShapeSpelling::classify` would recreate #118's symptom and
///   this pin would not notice. The claim here is about
///   `NodeShape::from_style_string` — the body *and* the choice of
///   it, which is what [`select_from_style_string`] makes provable —
///   and it is complete only about that one function.
/// - **What the macro is handed.** The message string, its format
///   arguments and its `"<area>: "` prefix (CODE_CONVENTIONS §9) are
///   not read. A `log::warn!("")` in the right arm passes.
/// - **What `log::warn!` means at the point it is compiled.** A
///   `macro_rules! warn` shadowing the real one, or a `use` that
///   rebinds `log`, is text this pin accepts and behavior it cannot
///   evaluate. Nothing here does that; the pin does not prove it.
/// - **Whether the level is right.** `ShapeReport::level()` is the
///   definition, so the pin holds the arm to whatever that says. If
///   `level()` itself were wrong, the pin would faithfully hold the
///   arms to the wrong answer —
///   `do_shape_report_levels_are_warn_and_trace` is the separate
///   assertion that the two levels are the ones §9 and #118 call for.
///
/// One escape closed itself in the restructure and is worth naming
/// because it costs nothing: `#[cfg(any())]` on a `match` arm now
/// makes the `match` non-exhaustive, so it is `error[E0004]` before
/// it is ever a test failure. Verified, not assumed.
///
/// §B8 asks for a `do_*()` body and a bench entry per test; the tests
/// in this module have neither, deliberately and with precedent —
/// §B8 opt-out class 1, the body cannot compile into the library.
/// `syn` is a dev-dependency, so a `pub` body in this `pub mod tests`
/// tree would not compile into the library, and `serde_coverage`'s
/// own consumer tests are plain `#[cfg(test)]` tests for the same
