//! Top-level container for multiple
//! [`Tree`](crate::gfx_structs::tree::Tree)s that together make up
//! one rendered frame.
//!
//! A `Scene` owns N `Tree<GfxElement, GfxMutator>` components,
//! each with its own *layer* (draw order) and screen-space *offset*.
//! The mindmap itself is one tree; borders, connections, the console
//! overlay, and the color picker are sibling trees at higher layers.
//!
//! The scene is the single hit-test and render entry point. Given a
//! screen-space point, `Scene::component_at` walks trees in
//! top-to-bottom draw order, asks each in turn whether it contains
//! the point, and returns the first `(SceneTreeId, NodeId)` hit.
//! Each individual tree then resolves the concrete target via
//! [`Tree::descendant_at`](crate::gfx_structs::tree::Tree::descendant_at)
//! — so the scene-level index stays cheap (O(trees)) and the
//! per-tree walk stays linear in the tree's own node count.
