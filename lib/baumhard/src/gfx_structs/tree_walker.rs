//! Walker that drives `MutatorTree::apply_to` — aligns mutators to

//! [`BranchChannel`](crate::gfx_structs::tree::BranchChannel) and
//! dispatches each mutator's effect. Handles straight-line
//! alignment, `Instruction::RepeatWhile` loop expansion (with the
//! [`Predicate`](crate::gfx_structs::predicate::Predicate) language),
//! and the event-propagation side channel that `GlyphTreeEvent`s
//! ride on. The single entry point is
//! [`walk_tree_from`](crate::gfx_structs::tree_walker::walk_tree_from);
//! everything else in this module is internal scaffolding kept
