//! Per-node background / hit-test shapes.
//!
//! [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::NodeShape`] is the single source of
//! truth for "what shape does this node occupy?". Both the renderer
//! (SDF fragment path) and the BVH hit test (point-in-shape check)
//! consult the same enum, so adding a new shape never drifts between
//! visuals and input.
//!
//! Extending the set is deliberately local:
//!
//! 1. Add a variant to the enum below.
//! 2. Give it its canonical `NodeStyle.shape` spelling(s) in
//!    [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::NodeShape::style_spellings`], and
//!    add that spelling to
//!    [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::KNOWN_SHAPES`] if it is not
//!    already listed. The `match` in `style_spellings` is
//!    exhaustive, so step 1 does not compile until this one is
//!    done — a new variant cannot silently stay on the
//!    quiet-fallback path.
//! 3. Add a `SHAPE_*` constant + a `case` arm to the rect pipeline's
//!    fragment shader (`src/application/renderer/mod.rs`,
//!    `RECT_SHADER_WGSL`). Forced, not remembered:
//!    `test_every_node_shape_has_a_matching_wgsl_constant_and_case_arm`
//!    in the mandala crate reads the shader as text and fails on a
//!    variant with no constant, a constant carrying the wrong id, and
//!    a non-default variant with no `case` arm — the last being the
//!    silent one, where every node of the new shape draws as a
//!    rectangle.
//! 4. Add a branch in
//!    [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::NodeShape::contains_local`] and
//!    [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::NodeShape::intersects_local_aabb`].
//!
//! No new structs, no new mutation surfaces, no new mesh builders.
//!
//! The format's shape vocabulary is deliberately wider than the set
//! this module can draw:
//! [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::KNOWN_SHAPES`] lists every canonical
//! spelling `format/enums.md` publishes and `maptool verify` accepts,
//! while `NodeShape` names only the ones with a shader case behind
//! them. [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::ShapeSpelling`] is the pure
//! classifier that tells those two populations apart, so a canonical
//! spelling awaiting its shader case degrades quietly to a rectangle
//! and only a genuine typo is reported to the author.
//! [`crate::gfx_structs::shape::ShapeReport`] is the second half of
//! that split: the *reporting* decision as a value, so what a load
//! says is data a test can read rather than a shape of `if`s only a
//! log sink could observe.
