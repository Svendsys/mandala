//! Baumhard — glyph-oriented rendering primitives for Mandala.
//!
//! Owns the GPU-adjacent data model: the `Tree<GfxElement,
//! GfxMutator>` that underpins every glyph layout, the mindmap
//! model and scene builder, shader entry points, and the
//! declarative mutator-builder DSL.
//!
//! Prescriptive rules (mutation-not-rebuild, arena discipline,
//! benchmark-reuse, no-unsafe) live in
//! `lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md` — read them before touching this
//! crate.

// CODE_CONVENTIONS §9 closes with "Bare `unwrap()` outside tests is
// a bug", and this is the half of that rule an editor can tell you
// about while you type. `util::unwrap_posture` is the other half —
// it reads the workspace's source text and fails `./test.sh`, which
// is a hard gate where clippy here is advisory. Two mechanisms
// rather than one because they disagree usefully: the lint sees
// post-expansion code the text scan cannot read, and the scan sees
// the `pub mod tests;` trees the lint has to be told about.
//
// The `cfg_attr` is what keeps the lint off test code. A
// `#[cfg(test)] mod` does not exist in the build where the lint is
// live, and in the build where it does exist the whole crate is
// allowed — so `unwrap()` stays the right spelling in a test and a
// bug everywhere else.
