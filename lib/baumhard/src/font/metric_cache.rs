//! Per-`(face, font_size_pt, grapheme)` measured glyph metrics.
//!
//! Replaces the static `MONOSPACE_ADVANCE_RATIO = 0.6` /
//! `BORDER_APPROX_CHAR_WIDTH_FRAC = 0.6` approximations that the
//! border-rail math used for "how wide is one cluster". Those
//! approximations were calibrated against LiberationSans light
//! box-drawing chars; on every other glyph (`◆`, `━`, `┃`, `=`,
//! `#`, etc.) and on every other face the approximation diverged
//! from what cosmic-text actually shaped, producing the
//! alignment + tiling defects users see in the Border Toolkit
//! demo on `maps/testament.mindmap.json`.
//!
//! The fix is structural: every callsite that asks "how wide
//! will this glyph end up?" or "how tall will this row of glyphs
//! be?" routes through this cache. The cache returns the value
//! cosmic-text actually uses when shaping, so the math + the
//! layout agree at sub-pixel precision.
//!
//! ## Cache discipline
//!
//! - Key: two levels. The outer map is keyed `(Option<AppFont>,
//!   OrderedFloat<f32>)` — the face pin (None = cosmic-text's
//!   default fallback face) and the size in points, both `Copy`.
//!   The inner map is keyed by the grapheme cluster ("│", "◆·",
//!   etc.), which multi-grapheme clusters preserve as a unit
//!   because they shape together.
//!
//!   **The split is what lets a lookup probe with a `&str`.** A
//!   single tuple key carrying a `String` cannot be borrowed from
//!   `(face, size, &str)` — `HashMap::get` needs `K: Borrow<Q>`,
//!   and no `Q` borrows out of a tuple — so the flat shape this
//!   replaced built an owned `String` before *every* probe, on hits
//!   as well as misses, at each of the four entry points. Splitting
//!   the key moves the only borrowable component into a map of its
//!   own, where `&str` is exactly what `get` takes. The two levels
//!   carry the same equivalence classes as the flat key: nothing
//!   merges and nothing splits, so no measurement changes.
//! - Hit: read-locked `RwLock`, O(1); no `FONT_SYSTEM` access, and
//!   no allocation.
//! - Miss (unlocked caller): acquires the `FONT_SYSTEM` write
//!   guard through `acquire_font_system_write` — the timeout-
//!   guarded helper, never a raw `.write()` (CONVENTIONS §B5) —
//!   shapes the cluster through cosmic-text, stores the result.
//!   Subsequent calls for the same key hit the cache.
//! - Miss (caller already holding the guard): use the
//!   `*_with(&mut FontSystem, ...)` variants, which shape through
//!   the passed guard instead of acquiring a second one. The
//!   renderer's border-rebuild loop holds the write guard across
//!   the whole loop and MUST use these — a nested same-thread
//!   acquire is a guaranteed deadlock. This mirrors the
//!   `measure_glyph_ink_bounds` / `measure_text_block_unbounded`
//!   composable design in `font/fonts.rs`.
//! - Invalidation: implicit. When the user swaps the active
//!   font, the new `AppFont` discriminator produces a different
//!   outer key; the previous face's inner map becomes dead memory
//!   until process exit.
//!
//!   What bounds that is the input rather than a byte count. An
//!   entry exists only for a `(face, size, cluster)` triple
//!   something actually asked to measure, so the dead set is at
//!   most what the session already measured — and a session cannot
//!   ask for a face it cannot select or a cluster it has not
//!   rendered. This bullet used to close with "every entry is ~12
//!   bytes", which is wrong twice over: 12 bytes is the size of
//!   [`InkExtent`](crate::font::metric_cache::InkExtent) alone, so
//!   it counted neither the `String` key (whose text is on the
//!   heap) nor the table's per-slot overhead, and it did not
//!   describe an `ADVANCE_CACHE` entry at all.
//!
//! ## Why not just measure inline at every call site?
//!
//! `border_run_specs` runs per visible node per scene rebuild and
//! asks for roughly a dozen clusters per node. Measuring one
//! cluster means allocating a cosmic-text `Buffer`, setting its
//! text, running `shape_until_scroll` and walking the layout runs
//! — and for [`glyph_ink`](crate::font::metric_cache::glyph_ink),
//! rasterizing the glyph through a `SwashCache` — all of it while
//! holding the `FONT_SYSTEM` **write** guard, the lock the whole
//! renderer serializes on
//! (§B5). A hit is a hash lookup under a **read** guard: it takes
//! no write lock, reaches no font system, and allocates nothing.
//!
//! **The lock round-trip per lookup is untouched by this**, and the
//! issue that motivated the key change (#36 item 3) names it in the
//! same breath as the allocation. A hit still acquires the read guard
//! once per call, so an N-cluster border pattern going through
//! [`cluster_width`](crate::font::metric_cache::cluster_width) is
//! still N acquires. Removing that needs a batching entry point that
//! holds one guard across a run of clusters — a new surface rather
//! than a key change — and it has not been built.
//!
//! That difference is stated in operations rather than in times on
//! purpose. This paragraph used to carry three numbers — "~100µs"
//! to shape, "~100 ns" per hit, and a "~1000× speedup" derived
//! from them — and `lib/baumhard/CONVENTIONS.md` §B7 requires a
//! main-against-main control row for any of the three. There was
//! none, so they are gone rather than restated.
//!
//! ## Public API
//!
//! - [`glyph_advance`](crate::font::metric_cache::glyph_advance) —
//!   horizontal advance of a single grapheme cluster (used by
//!   horizontal-rail char-count math).
//! - [`glyph_ink`](crate::font::metric_cache::glyph_ink) — the full
//!   ink extent (height plus top offset) of a single cluster, which
//!   is what the vertical-rail line-height math actually reads.
