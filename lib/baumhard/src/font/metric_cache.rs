//! Per-`(face, font_size_pt, grapheme)` measured glyph metrics.
//!
//! Replaces the static `MONOSPACE_ADVANCE_RATIO = 0.6` /
//! `BORDER_APPROX_CHAR_WIDTH_FRAC = 0.6` approximations that the
//! border-rail math used for "how wide is one cluster". Those
//! approximations were calibrated against LiberationSans light
//! box-drawing chars; on every other glyph (`◆`, `━`, `┃`, `=`,
//! `#`, etc.) and on every other face the approximation diverged
//! from what cosmic-text actually shaped, producing the
//! alignment + tiling defects users see in the Border Toolkit
//! demo on `maps/testament.mindmap.json`.
//!
//! The fix is structural: every callsite that asks "how wide
//! will this glyph end up?" or "how tall will this row of glyphs
//! be?" routes through this cache. The cache returns the value
//! cosmic-text actually uses when shaping, so the math + the
//! layout agree at sub-pixel precision.
//!
//! ## Cache discipline
//!
//! - Key: `(Option<AppFont>, OrderedFloat<f32>, String)` — the
//!   `Option<AppFont>` carries the face pin (None = cosmic-text's
//!   default fallback face); the `String` is the grapheme cluster
//!   ("│", "◆·", etc.) — multi-grapheme clusters shape together
//!   so the cache key has to preserve them as a unit.
//! - Hit: read-locked `RwLock`, O(1).
//! - Miss: acquires `FONT_SYSTEM.write()`, shapes the cluster
//!   through cosmic-text, stores the result. Subsequent calls
//!   for the same key hit the cache.
//! - Invalidation: implicit. When the user swaps the active
//!   font, the new `AppFont` discriminator produces a different
//!   cache key; old entries become dead memory until process
//!   exit. Acceptable — every entry is ~12 bytes.
//!
//! ## Why not just measure inline at every call site?
//!
//! `border_run_specs` runs per visible node per scene rebuild.
//! Shaping a single cluster through cosmic-text takes ~100µs
//! (allocate scratch buffer, set_text, shape_until_scroll). With
//! ~12 unique clusters per node and N visible nodes, an
//! uncached pass would cost N × 12 × 100µs = 12 ms / 10 nodes
//! per rebuild. The cache reduces hot-path lookups to a
//! `HashMap` read (~100 ns each), giving a ~1000× speedup on
//! re-renders.
//!
//! ## Public API
//!
//! - [`glyph_advance`] — horizontal advance of a single grapheme
//!   cluster (used by horizontal-rail char-count math).
//! - [`glyph_ink_height`] — vertical extent of a single grapheme
//!   cluster's rasterized ink (used by vertical-rail line-height
//!   math; without this, vertical glyphs are stacked at the full
//!   `font_size` line-height even when their natural height is
//!   smaller, producing visible gaps between glyphs).
